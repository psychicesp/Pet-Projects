# Grundus’ Bedroom:

-----
## Bed


The centerpiece of the room is a very large bed, dressed in sheets made from extremely finely woven mithril and are luxuriously soft for any fabric, much less one made from woven metal.  The pillows feel like they must be filled with a mithril-wool of the same surprisingly plush woven metal.  The mattress as well.  
The headboard and frame are also a finely-wrought mithril with impossible detail.  While mostly mithril there appears to be at least a dozen other metals making up hundreds of alloys decorating the headboard/frame.

## Bedside Table


Like everything else in the room, the design of the nightstand is wrought mainly of mithril and is impossibly intricate.  There is a glass vase of “flowers”, though they are also wrought from mithril alloys.  A finely wrought keyhole is clearly visible in the nightstand drawer, but that’s odd considering every other lock in this place has been invisible and made from Dwarven Mechatronics.


-----
## Closet

Other than the usual exceptionally architecture of the walls, the closet shelves are completely empty.  There is a Bag of Holding made from the same woven ultrafine mithril wool as the bedclothes. It appears to have double the interior space of a typical Bag of Holding. Everything inside is made of the same exceptional craftsmenship, style, and materials as the rest of Grundus' bedroom.

## Portrait


On the wall hangs an entirely metal, yet intricately detailed and fully color portrait of Grundus with an artistic smoky background, about 4’x8’.  His body is free of his metallic branding in the portrait.

## Mirror

Part of the wall has been polished to a mirror shine.  Mithril mirrors were sought after in an earlier time (no longer now that such exceptional materials are so impossible to come by) and now that you see one, you see why.  It doesn't just reflect light, it *gathers* it, illuminating your face with an even soft light and making your reflection backlit.
