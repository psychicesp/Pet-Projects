# Grundus’ Bedroom:

-----
## Bed


The centerpiece of the room is a very large bed, dressed in sheets made from extremely finely woven mithril and are luxuriously soft for any fabric, much less one made from woven metal.  The pillows feel like they must be filled with a mithril-wool of the same surprisingly plush woven metal.  The mattress as well.  
The headboard and frame are also a finely-wrought mithril with impossible detail.  While mostly mithril there appears to be at least a dozen other metals making up hundreds of alloys decorating the headboard/frame.

*Touching the sheets/bed/pillows reveals them to be, unsurprisingly, not very warm.  The conductive and finely woven metal serves as a very effective heat-sink and radiator and cools you quickly.  Grundus must be a hot sleeper.*

*Under the bed is a somewhat large box containing a few sets of extra sheets and a few extra pillows which, consistent with other dwarven works, packs away in a surprisingly small and compact manner*

## Bedside Table


Like everything else in the room, the design of the nightstand is wrought mainly of mithril and is impossibly intricate.  There is a glass vase of “flowers”, though they are also wrought from mithril alloys.  A finely wrought keyhole is clearly visible in the nightstand drawer, but that’s odd considering every other lock in this place has been invisible and made from Dwarven Mechatronics.

*Closer inspection reveals that the vase, though crystal clear, is actually made by metallurgy, and is some impossible [though apparently not] crystal clear alloy.  Its weight and Grundus’ clear preference for material suggests mithril, but do you really know?*

*Unlocking it was surprisingly easy.  More complex than most locks you’d find in human settlements, but for someone like Grundus you get the impression that, while functional, this was only meant to be decorative.  Maybe his reputation was so good that Dwarves knew better than to try.*

*Within the drawer appears to be Grundus’ favorite blacksmithing hammer. It looks like a Mithril/Adamantine alloy but is heavier than lead, which is inconsistent with either metal. The hammer has only one striking head and on the other side there is a socket for a large gem.  For any other smith, you would assume that the socket had never been filled, it being toothed in with a supposedly indestructible alloy, but based on everything else in the room its pretty apparent that Grundus would be able to unsocket a gem from indestructible material leaving both perfectly intact.*

## Portrait


On the wall hangs an entirely metal, yet intricately detailed and fully color portrait of Grundus with an artistic smoky background, about 4’x8’.  His body is free of his metallic branding in the portrait.

*Closer inspection reveals that, despite the prevalence of alloys and other metals elsewhere in the room, the portrait is made entirely of a single mithril alloy.  It appears to get its convincing appearance of color from an optical trick in the way it reflects light.*

*Also, the portrait appears not to be of Grundus, but of someone who looks strikingly like him, maybe his father?*

*As you move your head the smoke in the background moves impossibly, caressing the arms of the man in the portrait in a way that suggests life and consciousness. Something face-like appears to materialize and dematerialize in the smoke .   While it is hard to explain, there is a strikingly feminine character about the smoke. Was his mother some sort of elemental?*
