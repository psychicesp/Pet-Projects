 b'aming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a com'
 b'bination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant con'
 b'tains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from wh'
 b'ich up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spre'

 b'ore conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the myster'
 b'ious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the '
 b"<i>Machine of Lum the Mad</i>. The best details on the device's origins and "
 b"operation can be found in the <i>Mind of Metal</i>, a tome of artificer's se"
 b'crets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, a'
 b"nd which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum "
 b'the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled <i>Mighty Servant'
