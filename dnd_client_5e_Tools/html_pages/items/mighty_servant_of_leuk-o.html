Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.</p><p>Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the <i>Machine of Lum the Mad</i>. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the <i>Mind of Metal</i>, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled <i>Mighty Servant of Leuk-o</i>.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="516"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Dangerous Attunement.</span></span> <p>Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time.
