When processed and woven properly, the resulting cloth is pride silk: an extremely flexible material with the durability of tanned leather. Pride silk has become a favorite cloth for use on military ship sails, war banners, and other utilitarian applications, but has also gained popularity in affluent circles. High-end clothing made from pride silk is both fashionable and protective, leading many nobles and wealthy merchants to seek full outfits and formal gowns made with it. The tailors skilled enough to create such outfits are few and far between, so while pride silk might be expensive as a raw material, outfits made of the cloth are prohibitively expensive for most common folk.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><b>Source:</b> <i title="Explorer\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to Wildemount">EGW</i>, page 103</td></tr><tr><th class="border" colspan="6"></th></tr></table>')
