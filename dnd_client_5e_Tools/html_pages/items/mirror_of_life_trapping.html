 b'tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creature'
 b's. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnera'
 b'bility to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0'
 b' hit points.</p><p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you ar'
 b'e within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and a'
 b'ctivate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the comman'
 b'd word again.</p><p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in '
 b'the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Char'
 b'isma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carryi'
 b"ng, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw "
 b"is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constr"
 b'ucts succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p><p>An extradimensional ce'
 b'll is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 1'
 b"0 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't ne"
 b'ed to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape usin'
 b'g magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to t'
 b'he cell until freed.</p><p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve ext'
 b'radimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creat'
 b'ure at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in a'
 b'n unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If th'
 b'e mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in uno'
 b'ccupied spaces near it.</p><p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use'
 b' an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a par'
 b'ticular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell ap'
 b"pears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then com"
 b'municate normally.</p><p>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a '
 b'second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed c'
 b'reature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest'
 b' to the mirror and facing away from it.</p></div><div><span class="bold">Fou'
