 b'ce contracts forged in the Hall of Concordance in the city of Sigil. Primus,'

 b're law in Sigil, the City of Doors. In the hall, two parties who agree to mu'
 b'tual terms\xe2\x80\x94and who pay the requisite gold to the Kolyarut, a m'
 b'echanical engine of absolute jurisprudence\xe2\x80\x94can have their cont'
 b'ract chiseled onto a sheet of gold that is placed in the chest of a marut. F'
 b'rom that moment until the contract is fulfilled, the marut is bound to enfor'
 b'ce its terms and to punish any party who breaks them. A marut resorts to let'
 b'hal force only when a contract calls for it, when the contract is fully brok'
 b'en, or when the marut is attacked.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div'

 b' letter. A marut enforces what is written, not what was meant by or supposed'
 b' to be understood from the writing. The Kolyarut rejects contracts that cont'
 b"ain vague, contradictory, or unenforceable terms. Beyond that, it doesn't ca"
 b"re whether both parties understand what they're agreeing to. A small army of"
 b' solicitors waits outside the Hall of Concordance, eager to sell their exper'
 b'tise in the crafting or vetting of contracts.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-'
