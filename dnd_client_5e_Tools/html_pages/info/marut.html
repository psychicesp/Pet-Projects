In the hall, two parties who agree to mutual terms\xe2\x80\x94and who pay the requisite gold to the Kolyarut, a mechanical engine of absolute jurisprudence\xe2\x80\x94can have their contract chiseled onto a sheet of gold that is placed in the chest of a marut. From that moment until the contract is fulfilled, the marut is bound to enforce its terms and to punish any party who breaks them. A marut resorts to lethal force only when a contract calls for it, when the contract is fully broken, or when the marut is attacked.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4849"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Word Is Law.</span></span> <p>Inevitables care nothing for the spirit of an agreement, only the letter.
