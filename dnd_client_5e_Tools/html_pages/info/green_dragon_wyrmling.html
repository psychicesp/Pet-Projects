 b'use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. N'
 b'asty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting '
 b'and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dra'
 b'gons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is'
 b' about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.</p><p>A g'
 b'reen dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins ne'
 b'ar its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind t'
 b'he skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked pla'
 b"tes that run down the sides of its neck.</p><p>A wyrmling green dragon's thi"
 b'n scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green '
 b'dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, e'
 b'merald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. It'
 b's wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter to'
 b"ward the trailing edges.</p><p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation "
 b'to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over unde'
 b'rbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older'
 b' green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p><div cl'

 b' the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and sm'
 b'all trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p><div class='
 b'"rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Green dragons are consummate liars and master'
 b's of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ mo'
 b're subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon atta'
 b'cks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with p'
 b'otential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a g'
 b'reen dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire fo'
 b'r treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it f'
 b'urther its ambitions.</p><p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans it'
 b's assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the '
 b'dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never s'
 b'lays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over '
 b"survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near"
 b' its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occ'
 b'asionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature m'
 b'ust prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p></div><div class="rd__b r'
