 b'touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an inten'
 b'se desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of'
 b' a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new red caps look like tiny bloo'
 b'dstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight s'
 b'hines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersi'
 b'zed gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The'
 b' creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron b'
 b'oots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desire'
 b's only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.</p><di'
 b'v class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Redcaps lack subtlety. They live for '
 b'direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wante'
 b'd to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous step'
 b's. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distanc'
 b'e quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can rea'
 b'ct.</p><p>Also, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to'
 b' their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator '
 b'and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjo'
 b'y proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation '
 b'of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve'
 b" as cohorts, emulating that creature's murderous handiwork.</p><p>In any cas"
 b'e, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in vi'
 b"ctims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap's natural and necessary urge fo"
 b"r blood risks becoming the redcap's next target.</p><p>As subtle as a flung "
