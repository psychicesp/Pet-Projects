 b'long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before reali'
 b'zing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances'
 b" and in places steeped with nature's magic. Treants and powerful druids can "
 b'sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in'
 b' secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the l'
 b'ong process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a '
 b'division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to'
 b' serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the '
 b'clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.</p><d'
