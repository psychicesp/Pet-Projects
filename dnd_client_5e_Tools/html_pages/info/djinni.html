 b'ses a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. Djinn resent the cruel wizard'
 b's that have imprisoned their kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instrume'

 b' genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the pr'
 b'imordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does su'
 b'ch an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a geni'
 b'e.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A genie usually retains no c'
 b'onnection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block'
 b" that determines the genie's form and apparent gender, as well as one or two"
 b' key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are '
 b"elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate with other genies or "
 b'produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterio'
 b'us fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger conn'
 b'ection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, althou'
 b'gh such offspring are rare.</p><p>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing b'
 b'ehind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of it'
 b's native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke,'
 b' or a burst of water and foam.</p><p>In contrast to their love of slaves, mo'
 b'st genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will o'
 b'f another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the pow'
 b'er of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant w'
 b'ishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into s'
 b'ervice.</p><p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, '
 b'asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the i'
 b'nfluence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature th'
 b"at can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden to any noble genie, h"
 b"owever, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie's will and risk the "
 b'consequences.</p><p>Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, a'
 b'nd the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into '
 b'believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that'
 b' mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down before the'
 b'm.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-ti'

 b"gh self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie's ears, wh"
 b'ile two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lo'
 b'rd and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without pr'
 b'operty amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treas'
 b'ure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil'
