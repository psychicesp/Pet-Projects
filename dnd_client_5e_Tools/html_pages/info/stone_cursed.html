 b'span> <p>As part of the ritual used to create a stone cursed, a fist-sized o'
 b"bsidian skull forms within the creature's torso. The skull isn't visible whi"
 b'le the stone cursed is active, but when it is slain, the statue shatters and'
 b' the skull clatters to the ground. Because it is the nexus for the alchemy u'
 b"sed to create these horrors, a dim echo of the original victim's memories re"
 b'sonates within the skull. A skilled magic-wielder can attempt to extract mem'
 b"ories from it to gain insight into the victim's past or find lore that other"
 b'wise would be lost.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div cla'
