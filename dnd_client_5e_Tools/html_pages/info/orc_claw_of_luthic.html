Different groups of orcs exist within a tribe, the actions of each dictated by the deity they pay homage to. To complement the various kinds of warriors that spill forth to ravage the countryside, each tribe has members that remain deep inside the lair, seldom if ever seeing what lies outside the darkness of their den.</p><p>In addition, orcs have special relationships with two creatures that are sometimes found in their company: the aurochs, a great bull that serves as a mount for warriors that revere Bahgtru, and the tanarukk, a demon-orc crossbreed that is so depraved and destructive that even orcs seek to kill it. The aurochs is described in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5650"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Orc Claw of Luthic.</span></span> <p>Luthic is Gruumsh's wife and the paragon of maternity to all orcs.
