 b' place where the Feywild touches the world in proximity to an intelligent be'
 b'ing that feels isolated or abandoned. For example, a forsaken child might un'
 b'intentionally conjure a boggle and see it as a sort of imaginary friend. A b'
 b"oggle might also appear in the attic of a lonely widower's house or in the c"
 b'aves of a hermit.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3'

 b"s, passing the time at their hosts' expense. A boggle isn't above breaking d"
 b'ishes, hiding tools, making frightening sounds to startle cows and sour thei'
 b"r milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's antics might cause"
 b' distress and unintentional harm, mischief-not mayhem-is usually its intent.'

 b'gle can create magical openings to travel short distances or to pilfer items'

 b' boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open wind'
 b'ow or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening between th'
 b'e feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a '
 b'few seconds-enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.'
