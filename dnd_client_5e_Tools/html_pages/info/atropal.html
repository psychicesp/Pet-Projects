Since an atropal was never truly alive, it can't be raised from the dead or resurrected by any means. Even divine intervention can't breathe true life into this hateful, miserable horror.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>An atropal is malformed and unfinished. Its wet, wrinkled, and bloated body is surmounted by a hairless, overlarge head set with glassy, vacant eyes. It constantly drools stinking ichor as it mouths obscenities. Its arms are too slender, with tiny hands ending in cruelly shaped nails. An atropal never walks but always floats, with its atrophied, dead legs hanging useless below it.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="926"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Negative Energy Connection.</span></span> <p>The shriveled umbilical cord of an atropal appears to trail off into nothingness, but in fact, it attaches to the Negative Plane. This connection gives the atropal power over death and undeath. The cord can be severed by a vorpal sword or other vorpal weapon, and doing so weakens the atropal's tie to the Negative Plane.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>An atropal can summon vestiges of creatures that died in the Negative Plane, which manifest as wraiths. These servants can exist outside the Negative Plane only by the atropal's sheer force of will, and they quickly dissipate when the atropal is destroyed.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="927"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>An atropal doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>
