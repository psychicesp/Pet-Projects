 b'heir creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to di'
 b'vide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he'
 b' learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, b'
 b'ut those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had a'
 b'lready been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded wit'
 b'h a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountain'
 b's, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was '
 b'the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other '
 b'races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, '
 b'elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p'
 b'>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian h'
 b"alf-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since the"
 b'n, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his inj'
 b'ury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who wil'
 b'lingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p></div><div class="rd__b r'
