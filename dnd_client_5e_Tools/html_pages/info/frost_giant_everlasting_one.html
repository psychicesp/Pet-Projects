 b'desperation. Vaprak likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followe'
 b"d by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from such visi"
 b'ons or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost '
 b'giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a'
 b' troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in secret. Th'
 b"e troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the bol"
 b'dest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.</p><div '

 b'lity. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl '
 b"and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't "
 b"give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the "
 b'frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty s'
 b'cars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra '
 b'heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting'
 b' one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of '
 b'everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the "blessing" and worsh'
 b'ip of Vaprak from one generation to the next.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-'
