 b'anny presence from beyond death that allows a scarecrow to inspire fear in t'
 b'hose it gazes upon. Hags and witches often bind scarecrows with the spirits '
 b"of demons, but any evil spirit will do. Although aspects of the spirit's per"
 b"sonality might surface, a scarecrow's spirit doesn't recall the memories it "
 b'had as a creature, and its will is focused solely on serving its creator. If'
 b' its creator dies, the spirit inhabiting a scarecrow either continues to fol'
 b"low its last commands, seeks revenge for its creator's death, or destroys it"
