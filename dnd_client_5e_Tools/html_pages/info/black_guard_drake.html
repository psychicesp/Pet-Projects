 b'originally devised by the cult of Tiamat, but has spread to other groups tha'
 b't are skilled in arcana and associated with dragons. The cooperation of a dr'
 b'agon is necessary for the ritual to succeed, and a dragon typically provides'
 b' its help when it wants to reward its allies or worshipers with a valuable s'
 b'ervant.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The ritual, which takes'
 b' several days, requires 10 pounds of fresh dragon scales (donated by the dra'
 b'gon allied with the group), a large amount of fresh meat, and an iron cauldr'
 b'on. When the process is complete, a halfling-sized egg emerges from the caul'
 b'dron and is ready to hatch within a few hours.</p><p>A guard drake resembles'
 b' the type of dragon it was created from, but with a wingless, squat, muscula'

 b'uard drakes.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--'
