 b'></span> <p> Neogi usually dwell in far-flung locations on the Material Plan'
 b'e, as well as in the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the Astral and Ethereal Pl'
 b'anes. They invaded the world long ago from a remote location on the Material'
 b' Plane, abandoning their home to conquer and devour creatures in other realm'
 b's. To meet their need to navigate great distances, the neogi first dominated'
 b' and assimilated the umber hulks of another lost world. Then, with these sla'
 b'ves providing the physical labor, the neogi designed and built sleek vessels'
 b', some capable of traversing the planes, to carry them to their new frontier'
 b's. Some neogi groups still create and use such vehicles, which have a distin'
 b'ct spidery aspect.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Some neogi u'
 b'se magic-the result of a pact between the neogi and aberrant entities they m'
 b'et during their journey from their home world. These entities look like star'
 b's and embody the essence of evil. They are known by such names as Acamar, Ca'
 b'iphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar.</p><p>Nothing about the neogi is more unfathomabl'
 b'e than their mentality. Because they have the power to control minds, neogi '
 b'consider doing so to be entirely appropriate. Their society makes no distinc'
 b'tion between individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature has t'
 b"o control others, and they don't comprehend the emotional aspects of existen"
 b'ce that humans and similar beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as forei'
 b'gn a sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of authority is f'
 b'oolishness.</p><p>Neogi mark themselves and their slaves through the use of '
 b'dyes, transformational magic, and tattoos intended to signify rank, achievem'
 b'ents, and ownership. By these signs, each neogi can identify its betters-and'
 b' it must defer to those of higher station or risk harsh punishment.</p><p>Da'

 b'-Volo</p><p>Outside the obligations of a servant to its master, neogi are wi'
 b'lling to engage in any activity that profits them, and they are as devious a'
 b's devils when doing so. Neogi buy and sell, but they pose a grave risk to po'
 b'tential patrons that might instead be easily enslaved, so their customers ge'
 b'nerally consist of desperate or evil individuals, or creatures that are form'
 b'idable enough to treat with the neogi as equals. Neogi traders might set up '
 b'shop in a planar bazaar, on the edge of a drow city, or near a mind flayer e'
 b'nclave. In other locations, the natives are more likely to join together to '
 b'destroy a neogi caravan than to allow it safe conduct and trading privileges'
