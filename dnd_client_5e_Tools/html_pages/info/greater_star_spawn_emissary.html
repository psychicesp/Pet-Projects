 b'ssaries can assume two forms: a lesser form suited to infiltration and a gre'
 b'ater, physically overwhelming form. To destroy an emissary, characters must '
 b'reduce each of its forms to 0 hit points one after another. Typically, a sta'
 b'r spawn emissary is initially encountered in its lesser form. When this form'
 b" is destroyed, the emissary's body collapses into a gory slurry. It then ins"
 b'tantly returns in its greater form. Only if the emissary is defeated in its '

 b'reater star spawn emissary regains its lesser form if it was destroyed. When'
 b' an emissary transitions from one form to another, it loses all the traits a'
