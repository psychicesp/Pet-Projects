 b'deep evil, the priests of Osybus steal the souls of others to fuel the pries'

 b'become an undead creature, potentially cheating the grave over and over.</p>'
 b'<p>This unholy order of priests was founded centuries ago by Osybus, a myste'
 b"rious figure of unfathomable ambition and evil. Osybus sought to use others'"
 b' souls as springboards to his own immortality. He forged pacts with any enti'
 b'ty that would give him more power and delved into any eldritch secret that w'
 b'ould prolong his life. He became a devotee of the Dark Powers and tapped int'
 b'o their immortal malice to fuel his apotheosis.</p><p>As his power grew, he '
 b'attracted disciples who also wished to defy life and death. He shared his dr'
 b'ead secrets with them and demanded their worship. In time, his goal was achi'
 b'eved: he became a lich of almost godly power. Acknowledging the role that hi'
 b's disciples played in his ascension, Osybus gifted them with a trace of his '
 b'power. Taking the form of a shadowy tattoo, this boon allows the priests to '
 b'steal souls as their master did and to cheat death and become undead horrors'
 b'.</p><p>The threat posed by Osybus and his disciples raised alarms far and w'
 b'ide. In response, the Ulmist Inquisition and the then-mortal Count Strahd vo'
 b'n Zarovich faced the lich in battle. Their bravery would have been for naugh'
 b"t if Osybus's disciples hadn't betrayed him. Fearing that their master would"
 b" eventually consume their souls, the disciples aided Osybus's foes and destr"
 b'oyed his physical form. As he perished, he uttered a curse upon them'
 b'\xe2\x80\x94that their immortality would fail them when they least expect'
 b'ed it and that he himself would become one of the Dark Powers. As a result o'
 b"f that curse, a priest of Osybus can't be certain that they will be reborn w"
 b'hen they perish.</p><p>In an effort to rid themselves of this curse, they de'
 b'voted themselves to the same Dark Powers with whom their master had communed'
 b'. They were given a mission: provide a person of nobility and might to serve'
 b' as an earthly vessel for these powers to enter the world and conquer it. If'
 b' they succeeded, their immortality would be assured. A suitable vessel they '
 b'did then find: Strahd von Zarovich. Working in shadows and through intermedi'
 b'aries, the priests whispered hatred to the count, and when his noble heart w'
 b'as corrupted, they were the ones who laid the path before him that led to th'
 b'e Amber Temple and his fall into vampirism.</p><p>But they were then betraye'
 b'd. Osybus had not lied; he had himself become one of the Dark Powers, and he'
 b' and the other Dark Powers had conjured up a misty prison to contain the new'
 b'ly immortal Strahd, thereby preventing the count from serving as the conquer'
 b'ing force that the priests sought to loose upon the world; thus they were de'
 b'nied their reward of immortality.</p><p>To this day, the priests of Osybus s'
 b'eek to unleash Strahd from the mists, often using adventurers as their pawns'
 b". They also ironically bear their hated founder's name, for they know it is "
 b'his original deathly gift that gives them their horrific powers.</p></div><d'
