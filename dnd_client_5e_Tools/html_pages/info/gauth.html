 b' <p> A gauth can survive on meat but prefers to sustain itself with power dr'
 b'ained from magic objects. If starved of magic for several weeks, it is force'
 b'd back to its home plane, so it constantly seeks new items to drain. A gauth'

 b'through the flawed connection, arriving immediately or several minutes later'

 b'to intimidate them, or as a spectator to its summoner in order to drain magi'

 b'its territory, but it might choose to enslave them and use them as lieutenan'
 b'ts. Gauths are less xenophobic than beholders, so they might form small clus'
 b"ters and work together, though they're just as likely to ignore each other e"
 b'ntirely.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div><'
