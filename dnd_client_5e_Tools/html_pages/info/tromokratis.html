<td class="text" colspan="6"><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><p>Most krakens roam the seas, shattering hulls and scattering fleets, but the kraken Tromokratis notoriously vents its wrath on coastal settlements. Whether it acts at the command of the god Thassa or to sate its own hunger, Tromokratis numbers among the most feared threats in the sea, having no fixed lair and wandering where it will. In recent memory, the massive menace rose from the waves to topple the Pyrgnos, Meletis's great repository of scholarly knowledge. Since that day, the polis keeps a watch specifically for Tromokratis.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="7921"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tromokratis as a Mythic Encounter</span></span> <p>Tromokratis numbers among the most powerful creatures a group of adventurers might face. If you wish to make an encounter with the kraken truly legendary, Tromokratis might use its Hearts of the Kraken mythic trait. When this happens, it calls upon a reserve of strength just as it appears to be vanquished. After its hearts are exposed, Tromokratis can choose one of its mythic actions when it uses a legendary action.</p><p>Read or paraphrase the following text when Tromokratis uses its Hearts of the Kraken trait:</p><div class="rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud"><p>The titanic monster's carapace cracks, revealing a pulsing, red-purple heart buried amid heaps of blubber and muscle. Fissures run across the beast's ancient shell, revealing three other mighty, ichor-slick organs. The sea terror thrashes, channeling pain into fury.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>Fighting Tromokratis as a mythic encounter is equivalent to taking on two CR 26 creatures in one encounter. Award a party 180,000 XP for defeating Tromokratis after it uses Hearts of the Kraken.</p></div></div></td>')
