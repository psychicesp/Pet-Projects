 b' Shadowfell, but the need for companionship is never manifested more dramati'
 b'cally than in the Lonely. When these sorrowsworn spot other creatures, they '

 b'rms to drag their victims close.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><'

 b'f despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneline'
 b'ss given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding h'
 b'ow they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negati'
 b've emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow dea'
 b'dlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.<'
