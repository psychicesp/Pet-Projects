 b'> <p> Vegepygmies, also called mold folk or moldies, inhabit dark areas that'
 b' are warm and wet, so they are most commonly found underground or in dense f'
 b'orests where little sunlight penetrates. A vegepygmy instinctively feels kin'
 b'ship with other plant and fungus creatures, and thus vegepygmy tribes coexis'
 b't well with creatures such as myconids, shriekers, and violet fungi.</p><div'
 b' class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Although they prefer to eat fresh meat'
 b', bone, and blood, vegepygmies can absorb nutrients from soil and many sorts'
 b' of organic matter, meaning that they rarely go hungry. A vegepygmy can hiss'
 b" and make other noises by forcing air through its mouth, but it can't speak "
 b'in a conventional sense. Among themselves, vegepygmies communicate by hissin'
 b'g, gestures, and rhythmic tapping on the body. Vegepygmies build and craft l'
 b'ittle; any gear they have is acquired from other creatures or built by copyi'
 b'ng simple construction they have witnessed.</p><p>As a vegepygmy ages, it gr'
 b'ows tougher and develops spore clusters on its body. Spore-bearing vegepygmi'
 b'es are deferred to by other vegepygmies, so outsiders refer to such vegepygm'
 b'ies as chiefs. A chief can expel its spores in a burst, infecting nearby cre'
 b'atures. If a creature dies while infected, its corpse produces vegepygmies t'
 b'he same way russet mold does.</p><p>No one knows for sure where russet mold '
 b'came from. One historical account tells of adventurers in a forbidding mount'
 b'ain range discovering russet mold and vegepygmies in a peculiar metal dungeo'
 b'n full of strange life. Another story says that explorers found russet mold '
 b'in a crater left by a falling star, with vegepygmies infesting the dense jun'
 b'gle nearby.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3'

 b'ehind when a humanoid or a giant is killed by russet mold. One or more vegep'
 b'ygmies emerge from the corpse a day later. If a beast such as a dog or a bea'
 b'r dies from russet mold, the result is a bestial moldie called a thorny resu'
 b'lt instead of a humanoid-shaped vegepygmy. Thornies are less intelligent tha'
 b'n vegepygmies, but have greater size and ferocity, as well as a thorn-covere'
