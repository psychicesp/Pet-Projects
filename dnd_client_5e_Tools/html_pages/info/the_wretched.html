These pitiful entities subsist on life force, so when they find a creature, they surge forward to sink their fangs into their victims and drink deep of their life energy and their fear.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7687"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Sorrowsworn.</span></span> <p>The Shadowfell\'s pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7688"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Emotion Given Form.</span></span> <p>Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them.

Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
