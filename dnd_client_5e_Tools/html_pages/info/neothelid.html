 b'bly wrong. On rare occasions, an illithid colony collapses, typically after '
 b'an external assault, and the elder brain is killed. When that happens, the c'

 b' food, and in turn are no longer fed by their caretakers. Driven by hunger, '

 b'hat grows larger than a few inches in length is killed by the elder brain to'

 b'd that state is perceived as a threat to the colony, and the mind flayers or'

 b'istence it has lived so far and struggles to comprehend its new psionic abil'

 b'te their constant hunger, growing ever more vicious. These creatures can spr'
 b'ay tissue-dissolving enzymes from their tentacle ducts, reducing victims to '
 b'a puddle of slime and leaving only the pulsing brain unharmed. They have no '
 b"knowledge of their link to illithids, so they're just as likely to prey on m"
 b'ind flayers as on anything else.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><'
