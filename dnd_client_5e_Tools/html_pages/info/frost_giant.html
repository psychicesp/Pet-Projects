 b', hill, stone, and storm giants-are related by common elements of history, r'
 b'eligion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent'
 b' animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to '
 b'a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organ'
 b'ized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its '
 b'place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or super'
 b'ior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a'
 b' different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Gian'
 b'ts make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At th'
 b'e highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked acco'
 b'rding to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cl'
 b'oud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finall'
 b'y giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a gian'
 b"t's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to "
 b'the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is supe'
 b"rior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered ev"
 b'il to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.</p></d'

 b"he giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his ch"
 b'ildren and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the gia'
 b'nts had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of '
 b'the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children,'
 b' along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giant'
 b"s' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose s"
 b'ons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for clo'
 b'ud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Sur'
 b'tur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatic'
 b"ally revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refu"
 b'se to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mo'
 b'untains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other gi'
 b"ants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, th"
 b'e huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancas'
 b'tra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</p><p>Some giants abandon their ow'
 b'n gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchi'
 b'e. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the o'
 b'rdning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.</p><div class="float-'
