 b'e related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view on'
 b'e another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambi'
 b'tion to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordni'
 b'ng. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social'
 b' rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant know'
 b's which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are'
 b' equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills o'
 b'r qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualiti'
 b'es the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, th'
 b'e races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are '
 b'the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost gia'
 b'nts, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ett'
 b"ins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the c"
 b'hief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. T'
 b'he lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant o'
 b"f an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a "

 b'mnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay'
