 b'forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns. The dragons that '
 b'lair in such places often discover these portals and find themselves transpo'
 b'rted to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs for months or'
 b' years at a time might find themselves spirited away, never knowing that a p'
 b'ortal has formed without their knowledge as they dream.</p><div class="rd__s'

 b"appens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose thei"
 b'r luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, '
 b'its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight ab'
 b'horrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Dark'
 b'ness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self. The magi'
 b'cal nature of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems so'
 b'mehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell'
 b' also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creat'
 b"ure remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months"
 b' and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes aware of the tran'
 b'sformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.</p><'

 b'any, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are ha'
 b'ppy to leave the Shadowfell behind forever, understanding that treasure and '
