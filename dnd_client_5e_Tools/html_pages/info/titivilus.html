 b', seeming to hide surrounded by its labyrinthine corridors, iron walls, diab'
 b'olical traps, and monstrous servants. So intense is his paranoia that he alm'
 b'ost never travels farther than the sprawling city that lies outside his magn'
 b'ificent palace. Dispater knows he has enemies on all sides\xe2\x80\x94ene'
 b'mies who would do to him what has been done to the likes of Geryon, Moloch, '
 b'and so many others.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Dispater is'
 b" correct to fear, but the true threat comes not from without. The lord's gre"
 b'at error was allowing himself to be seduced by Titivilus, who beguiled his w'
 b"ay into being the primary advisor in Dispater's household.</p><p>Although he"
 b' is inferior in physical strength and power when compared to other archdevil'
 b's, Titivilus compensates with cunning. A shrewd and calculating politician, '
 b'he has clawed his way up through the ranks to become the second-most powerfu'
 b'l fiend in Dis, entirely by saying just the right thing at the right time to'
 b' get what he wanted. Charming and pleasant, he is a master at negotiation, a'
 b'ble to twist words in such a way as to leave his victims confused and believ'
 b'ing they have found a friend in Titivilus. Through these skills, Titivilus h'
 b'as manipulated everyone along his path to power, either to win them over to '
 b'his cause or to remove them as a threat.</p><p>Since gaining his position, T'
 b'itivilus has convinced Dispater that countless plots are being hatched again'
 b'st him and that Asmodeus himself seeks to remove Dispater from power. In res'
 b'ponse, Dispater has withdrawn to his palace and left day-to-day decisions to'
 b' Titivilus, while also authorizing him to answer and negotiate bargains with'
 b' mortals who attempt to summon Dispater. Titivilus now represents his master'
 b' and speaks with his voice, a turn of events that leads some to whisper that'
 b' either Titivilus is Dispater in disguise, or that Titivilus has removed the'
 b' archduke and replaced him altogether.</p><p>Titivilus recognizes the inhere'
 b"nt precariousness of his position. After all, Dispater's acceptance of his p"
 b'lans and his advice can last only so long before some other plotter steps in'
 b' and reveals the truth. For insurance, Titivilus has begun recruiting outsid'
 b'ers to deal with problem devils, to insulate himself against criticism, and,'
 b' above all, to create complications that he can solve so as to reinforce his'
 b' value in the eyes of his master. Titivilus finds adventurers well suited to'
 b' the tasks he needs performed and recruits them directly or through intermed'
 b'iaries, expending them later as his plans require.</p></div></div></div></td'
