 b't ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civil'
 b'ized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creatur'
 b'e cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many'
 b' lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that anim'
 b'al form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On c'
 b'lose inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and m'
 b'ight glow red in the dark.</p><p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, e'
 b'merging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially u'
 b'nder a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around o'
 b'ther civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from vi'
 b'llages and towns.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"'

 b'its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its li'
 b'fe as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. Howeve'
 b'r, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transfo'
 b'rming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that'
 b' combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within '
 b'can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware o'
 b'f its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, tho'
 b'ugh those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some in'
 b'dividuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. W'
 b'ith time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability an'
 b'd can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embra'
