Many have the regal countenances of worldly queens, but some are marked with wild, leonine features. A gynosphinx's eyes see beyond the present time and place, and penetrate veils of invisibility and magic.</p><p>Supplicants who look deep into those eyes might find themselves magically displaced, banished to some far flung plane where a difficult trial awaits them.</p><p>Gynosphinxes are virtual libraries of knowledge and lore. They ask riddles and present puzzles to test the wit of supplicants that come to learn their secrets. Some are willing to bargain with such supplicants for treasure or service.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3392"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Sphinxes.</span></span> <p>In sacred isolation, a sphinx guards the secrets and treasures of the gods. As it calmly regards each new party that comes before it, the bones of supplicants and quest seekers that failed to pass its tests lie scattered around its lair. Its great wings sweep along its flanks, its tawny leonine body rippling with muscle and possessed of forepaws powerful enough to tear a humanoid in half. Divine Guardians. Sphinxes test the worth of those who seek the treasures of the gods, whether forgotten secrets or mighty spells, artifacts or magical gateways. Creatures that choose to face a sphinx's test are bound to that test unto death, and only those worthy will survive it. The rest the sphinx destroys.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Some sphinxes are high priests of the gods that create them, but most are simply embodied spirits, brought into the mortal realm by devout prayer or direct intervention. A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly, not needing to sleep or eat. It rarely engages with others of its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3393"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Magical Tests.</span></span> <p> The secrets and treasures a sphinx guards remain under divine protection, so that when a creature fails a sphinx's test, the path to the object or knowledge it guards vanishes. Even if a sphinx is attacked and defeated, a quester will still fail to gain the secret it sought-and will make an enemy of the god that placed the sphinx as a guardian.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Benign deities sometimes grant a sphinx the power to remove supplicants that fail their tests, transporting them away and ensuring that they never encounter the sphinx again. However, those who fail a sphinx's test typically meet a gruesome end beneath its claws.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3394"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Extraplanar Beings.</span></span> <p> Mortals that encounter sphinxes do so most often in ancient tombs and ruins, but some sphinxes can access extraplanar realms. A conversation with a sphinx that begins between tumbled stone walls might suddenly shift to an alien locale, such as a life-sized game board or a daunting cliff that must be climbed in a howling storm. Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3395"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Fallen Sphinxes.</span></span> <p> Whether through the weariness of the ages, regret at the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, some sphinxes break free of their divine command. However, even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it deems worthy.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3396"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">A Sphinx\'s Lair.</span></span> <p>A sphinx presides over an ancient temple, sepulcher, or vault, within which are hidden divine secrets and treasures beyond the reach of mortals.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="3397"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lair Actions</span></span> <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the sphinx can't use an effect again until it finishes a short or long rest:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li">The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll initiative.
