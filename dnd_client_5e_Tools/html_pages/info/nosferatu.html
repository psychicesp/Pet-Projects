 b'hunters, nosferatu possess the endless thirst of vampires but none of their '
 b'grace. For them, existence is nothing more than an everlasting string of col'
 b'd, desperate nights punctuated by crimson splashes of momentary warmth and l'
 b'ucidity. These joys are fleeting, as their blood addiction can never be quel'
 b'led.</p><p>Nosferatu feed on anything with blood. Heaps of mutilated rats an'
 b'd stables turned into slaughterhouses are typical first signs of a nosferatu'
 b"'s predation. When the sun interrupts their hunts, nosferatu retreat to favo"
 b"red ruins, sewers, or caves, caring nothing for their lair's comfort. Rather"
 b' than retiring to crypts, they seek filthy or inaccessible fissures, places '
 b'any living soul would avoid.</p><p>For a few moments after feeding, nosferat'
 b'u are lucid and capable of considering more than their next meal. In these i'
 b'nstants, nosferatu recollect glimpses of what they once were, beings who kne'
 b'w pride, intention, and a world beyond the shadows. They might even momentar'
 b'ily be convinced to converse with other creatures. However, those who talk w'
 b'ith nosferatu typically find them selfish, duplicitous creatures whose memor'
 b'ies are faded and whose basic respect for life is long dead.</p></div></td>')
