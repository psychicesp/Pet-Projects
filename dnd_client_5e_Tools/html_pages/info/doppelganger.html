 b'lity. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to imperso'
 b'nate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can '
 b"read a creature's surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature's nam"
 b'e, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger i'
 b'mpersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its '
