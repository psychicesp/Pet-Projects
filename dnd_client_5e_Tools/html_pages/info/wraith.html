 b'p>When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact'
 b', it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, so'
 b'metimes the soul becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses '
 b'in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to so'
 b'me horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wrait'
 b'h-a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of th'
 b"e wraith's former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only t"
 b'o annihilate other life.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><di'
