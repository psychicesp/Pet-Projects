 b'little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome infl'
 b'uence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners'
 b' of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beet'
 b'les to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the'
 b' power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomina'
 b'tion might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even drui'
 b"ds can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatura"
