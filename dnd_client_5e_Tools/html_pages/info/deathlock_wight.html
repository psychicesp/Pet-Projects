A deathlock in the thrall of a fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a Great Old One could be charged with hunting for the materials needed to call forth a horrifying entity into the world.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1116"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>A deathlock doesn\'t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
