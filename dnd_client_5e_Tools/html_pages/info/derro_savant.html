 b'actious in groups and individually weak, derro would have been driven to ext'
 b'inction long ago but for two elements of their character. They have an inbor'

 b'gate the dangers of the Underdark and its societies. They also have a strong'
 b'er-than-normal tendency to develop sorcerous power. Individuals who do so be'
 b'come their leaders, known as savants. The derro consider these sorcerers to '
