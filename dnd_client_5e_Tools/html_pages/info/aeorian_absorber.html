When Aeor crashed into Eiselcross, many of these magically mutated monstrosities survived, and they now stalk Aeor's ruins and the islands' icy wastes.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><span class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="315"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Created by Experimentation</span></span> <p>Aeorian hunters were created through arcane experimentation on beasts and humanoids—both captives and volunteers. These experiments resulted in monstrosities with brightly colored flesh and the power to resist and destroy Aeor's enemies. It is theorized that the mages of Aeor must have possessed some means of controlling their monstrous soldiers, but no such device has yet been found in the wastes of Eiselcross. Draconic was the language used by these mages to train and bind the Aeorian hunters, and the hunters retain an understanding of this language even though they can't speak it.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="316"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Madness through Immortality</span></span> <p>Aeorian hunters do not age.

Most scholars believe that Aeor's mages must have enchanted this behavior into them, given the cost in gold and magic required to create each hunter. Some adventurers in Eiselcross boast about sneaking past Aeorian hunters using disguises or illusions to mimic a hunter's form, but these are most likely tall tales.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="318"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Ageless Memories.</span></span> <p>Each Aeorian hunter has perfect recall of every experience since the moment of its creation.
