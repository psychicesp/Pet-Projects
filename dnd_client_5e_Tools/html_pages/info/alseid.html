Many live in closer proximity to human civilization than other nymphs.

Some are benevolent and aid those who live off the land, while others embody violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sapient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interplay of wild animals, or other cosmic forces. Occasionally, though, groups of the same kind of nymphs congregate in a place of natural power or beauty. In times of special need, deities tied to facets of nature might employ nymphs as messengers, guardians, or scouts.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="425"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Immortal Nature.</span></span> <p>A nymph doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>
