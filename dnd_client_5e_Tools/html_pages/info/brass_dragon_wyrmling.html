 b'roughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly'
 b' share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a br'
 b"ass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows i"
 b't. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might re'
 b'spond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature.'
