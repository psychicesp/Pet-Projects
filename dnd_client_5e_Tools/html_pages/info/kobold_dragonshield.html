 b'cowardice is still present in its makeup, and thus it might still run away f'
 b'rom a threat. But it also has the ability to rally in the face of certain de'
 b'ath, inspiring other kobolds to follow it in a charge against the invaders o'
 b'f their warren.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div>'
