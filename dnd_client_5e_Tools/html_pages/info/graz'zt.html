 b'n></span> <p>The appearance of the Dark Prince is a warning that not all bea'
 b"utiful things are good. Standing nearly nine feet tall, Graz'zt strikes the "
 b'perfect figure of untamed desire, every plane and curve of his body, every g'
 b'lance of his burning eyes, promising a mixture of pleasure and pain. A subtl'
 b'e wrongness pervades his beauty, from the cruel cast of his features to the '
 b"six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. Graz'zt can also transfo"
 b'rm himself at will, appearing in any humanoid form that pleases him, or his '
 b'onlookers, all equally tempting in their own ways.</p><div class="rd__spc-in'
 b'line-post"></div><p>Graz\'zt surrounds himself with the finest of things '
 b'and the most attractive of servants, and he adorns himself in silks and leat'
 b'hers both striking and disturbing in their workmanship. His lair, and those '
 b'of his cultists, are pleasure palaces where nothing is forbidden, save moder'
 b'ation or kindness.</p><p>The dark Prince of Pleasure considers restriction t'
 b'he only sin, and takes what he wants. Cults devoted to him are secret societ'
 b'ies of indulgence, often using their debauchery to subjugate others through '
 b'blackmail, addiction, and manipulation. They frequently wear alabaster masks'
 b' with ecstatic expressions and ostentatious dress and body ornamentation to '
 b'their secret assignations.</p><p>Although he prefers charm and subtle manipu'
 b"lation, Graz'zt is capable of terrible violence when provoked. He wields the"
 b' greatsword Angdrelve, also called Wave of Sorrow, its wavy, razor-edged bla'
 b'de dripping acid at his command.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--2">'

 b's Argent Palace, a grandiose structure in the city of Zelatar, found within '
 b"his Abyssal domain of Azzatar. Graz'zt's maddening influence radiates outwar"
 b'd in a tangible ripple, warping reality around him. Given enough time in a s'
 b"ingle location, Graz'zt can twist it with his madness. Graz'zt's lair is a d"
 b'en of ostentation and hedonism. It is adorned with finery and decorations so'
 b' decadent that even the wealthiest of mortals would blush at the excess. Wit'
 b"hin Graz'zt's lairs, followers, thralls, and subjects alike are forced to sl"
 b"ake Graz'zt's thirst for pageantry and pleasure.</p></div></div><div cla"
