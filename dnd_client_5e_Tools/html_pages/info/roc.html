As it descends, however, its unearthly size becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan spreads two hundred feet or more. At rest, perched upon the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous bird rivals the oldest dragons in size.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6453"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Sky Titans.</span></span> <p>In the ancient days when giants battled dragons for control of the world, Annam, the father of the giant gods, created the rocs so that his worshipers might challenge the dragons' dominance of the air.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>When the war ended, the rocs were freed from giant domination and spread throughout the world.</p><p>Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes tame these great birds, rocs treat even giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6454"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Remote and Alone.</span></span> <p>Rocs are solitary creatures that can live for centuries.

More rarely, a nest holds eggs that are taller than a human, produced by the rocs' infrequent mating.</p></div></div></div></td>')
