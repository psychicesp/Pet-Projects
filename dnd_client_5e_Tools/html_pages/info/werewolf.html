 b'r animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful versi'

 b'nnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.</p><p>Evil lycanthrope'

 b'A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the cu'
 b'rse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in hum'
 b'anoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urg'
 b'es raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes to'
 b'o strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into '
 b'a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the mo'
 b'on wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the c'
 b'ursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events'
 b' of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as b'
 b'loody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse '
 b'and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master the'
 b'ir shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. M'
 b'ost lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, be'
 b'coming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.</p></div></div><'
