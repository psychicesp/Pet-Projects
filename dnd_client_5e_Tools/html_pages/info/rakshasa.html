Few creatures ever see the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it wants, although it prefers to masquerade as someone powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich merchant, for example. A rakshasa's true form combines the features of a human and a tiger, with one noteworthy deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6120"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Evil Spirits in Mortal Flesh.</span></span> <p> Rakshasas originated long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6121"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Evil Reborn.</span></span> <p>For a rakshasa, death on the Material Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its body reforms-a process that can take months or years.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>When the rakshasa is reborn, it has all the memories and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution against the one who slew it.
