Gaunt and sallow faced, with concave bellies, bulging eyes, and taut skin that enunciates every bone, these living skeletons sustain themselves on nothing more than air and fanatical devotion to the teachings of the cult. The wind serves them at a gesture.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Howling Hatred priests see themselves as living extensions of Yan-C-Bin, and they help new recruits cast off the shackles of their old lives and embrace a "higher purpose." Once the new recruits are thus purified, the priests decide whether they are worthy for indoctrination as initiates or would better serve the Howling Hatred cult as sacrifices. The priests also uphold the doctrine of their prophet, inoth, and harshly punish any initiate who strays from the path.</p><p>Most other air cultists hate the priests, though none dares to speak out against them. Those that challenge the priests often end up the subjects of rigorous new attempts at purification.</p></div></div></div></td>')
