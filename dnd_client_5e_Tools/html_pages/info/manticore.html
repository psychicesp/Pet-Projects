 b'es are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They work together to'
 b' take down particularly large or dangerous creatures, sharing the meal once '
 b'a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack with a volley of tail spikes, '
 b'then lands and uses its claws and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it us'
 b'es its wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its spikes are d'
 b'epleted.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A manticore isn\'t '
 b'particularly bright, but it possesses a malevolent nature and the ability to'
 b' converse. In the course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to '
 b'kill them swiftly if they beg for their lives. If a manticore sees an advant'
 b"age to be gained by sparing a creature's life, it does so, asking for a trib"
 b'ute or sacrifice equal to its loss of food.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b'

 b'res serve wicked masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A ma'
 b'nticore might provide aerial support for an orc horde or a hobgoblin army. A'
 b'nother could serve as a hunting companion for a hill giant chief, or guard t'
 b'he entrance to a lamia\'s lair.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div'

 b'perytons, and wyverns. Manticores hunting as a pack often have the advantage'
 b' of greater numbers. In addition to these creatures, manticores fear dragons'
 b' and avoid them.</p></div></div></div></td>')
