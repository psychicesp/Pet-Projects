 b"ires who couldn't return to their burial places after being defeated or suff"
 b'ering some mishap. Denied the restorative power of these places, the vampire'

 b'from fog aside from the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on '
 b"a creature and causes the blood in its body to ooze through the creature's p"
 b'ores or spill out from its eyes, nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from '
 b'the victim like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. The feeding cau'
 b'ses no pain or discomfort to the victim, so vampiric mists can feed on sleep'
 b'ers without waking them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such tha'
 b't it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue that rains blood d'
 b'roplets wherever it goes.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><d'

 b'ile away. Any injury, no matter how small, might catch their attention and d'
 b'raw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist focuses its attacks on inju'
 b'red targets, since open wounds are a more ready source of blood.</p><div cla'
