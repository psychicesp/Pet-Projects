 b'Storm giants recall the glory of ancient giant empires forged by the god Ann'
 b"am. They seek to restore what was lost when those empires fell. They don't c"
 b'ompete for status in the ordning but live out the centuries of their existen'
 b"ce in contemplative seclusion, watching the starry heavens and the ocean's d"
 b'epths for signs, symbols, and omens of Annam\'s favor.</p><div class="rd_'
 b'_spc-inline-post"></div><p>Storm giants see the events of the world in a wid'
 b'e perspective. They can foretell the rise and fall of kings and empires, see'
 b' the beginnings and ends of fortune and disaster, and find the patterns with'
 b'in seemingly unrelated events. By reading omens and prophesying, storm giant'
 b's learn of vast secrets previously unknown and troves of lore utterly forgot'
 b'ten.</p><p>Kings will rise and fall, wars will be won and lost, and good and'
 b' evil will wrestle in conflict. Storm giants have watched these events in th'
 b'e manner of mortal gods over many lifetimes, and they know it is pointless t'
 b'o intervene. Even so, a storm giant might willingly disclose certain secrets'
 b' to benevolent beings that visit its remote domain with specific purpose. Su'
 b'ch creatures must speak and act respectfully, however, for a storm giant rou'
 b'sed to anger is a force of utter destruction.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd_'

 b'an class="entry-title-inner">The Ordning</span></span> <p>Each of the main g'
 b'iant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants-are related'
 b' by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another'
 b' as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a'
 b' minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based'
 b' on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to '
 b'each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which o'
 b'ther giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. E'
 b'ach of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualiti'
 b'es to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the pu'
 b'rpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races o'
 b'f the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highe'
 b'st in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, ston'
 b'e giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and '
 b"ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a"
 b' hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest'
 b' ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an infe'
 b"rior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of "
 b'another type, merely rude.</p></div><div class="rd__b-inset"><span class="rd'

 b"Giant Gods</span></span><p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, fat"
 b'her of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to loo'
 b'k upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaim'
 b'ed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to '
 b'Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godl'
 b"y villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods a"
 b're the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus'
 b' for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone gi'
 b'ants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill'
 b" giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, how"
 b'ever. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a s'
 b'torm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage '
 b"to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's "
 b'daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, godde'
 b'ss of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</'
 b'p><p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying'
 b' homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant d'
 b'eity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant '
 b'an outcast.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div></td>')
