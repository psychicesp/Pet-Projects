As passive parasites, they take only the mental energy they need, and most creatures feel no loss or discomfort from such feeding.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Consuming psionic energy reveals the thoughts and emotions of the creatures on which the flumphs feed. Since so many of those creatures are evil, flumphs are often subjected to thoughts, emotions, and hungers that sicken their pure nature. When flumphs encounter good-hearted adventurers, they eagerly share the dark secrets they have learned in the hopes of casting down their evil sources of energy, even if doing so means they must seek out new sources of nourishment.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2333"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Flumph Society.</span></span> <p>Flumphs live in complex and organized groups called cloisters, within which each flumph has a place and purpose.
