 b'slike ritual, which they perceive as complex and foreign. However, a cyclops'

 b' <p>Though they are reasonably intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive '
 b'lives, keeping herds of animals for food. They prefer to dwell alone or in s'
 b'mall family groups, lairing in caves, ruins, or rough structures of dry ston'
 b'e construction they build themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with '
 b'it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve '
 b'double duty as a barn.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A cyclop'
 b"s lairs within a day's journey of other cyclopes, so that they can meet to t"
 b'rade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, bu'
 b't will use metal when they can find it. Although cyclopes understand the Gia'
 b'nt tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures fo'
 b"r their interactions with each other. Cyclopes don't use money for trade, bu"
 b't they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewe'
 b'lry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with feathers and silver coins, '
 b'but also with pewter goblets, cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal.</p></'

 b"p>Cyclopes aren't great thinkers or strategists. Slow to learn and bound to "
 b'their traditional ways, they find innovation difficult. Although they are a '
 b'terrifying threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can often b'
 b'e tricked by clever foes. Cyclopes can be cowed and awed by obvious displays'
 b' of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can be deceived into '
 b'mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other caster for a powerful divine figure. H'
 b'owever, their sense of pride causes them to react with vengeful, bloodthirst'
 b'y violence once they learn that the individual they assumed was a "god" is a'
 b' mere mortal.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></'
