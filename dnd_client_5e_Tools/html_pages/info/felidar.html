 b'ose nature reflects an inherent devotion to law and order. It resembles an e'
 b'normous cat with two pairs of downward-sloping horns and prominent teeth. It'
 b's blue-gray hide has a silvery, geometric pattern, and its thick white mane '
 b'falls in an orderly fashion around its shoulders.</p><div class="rd__spc-inl'

 b'eature. Winged felidars almost always bond with archons, joining in their re'
 b'lentless pursuit of justice. Other felidars ally with members of the Azorius'
 b' Senate and form bonds with high-ranking justiciars and ministers, aiding th'
 b'em in enforcing the law and tracking down criminals. Some Azorius felidars f'
 b'orm bonds with important prisoners in Azorius custody, ensuring that the fel'
 b'idars can track down the felons if they escape custody.</p></div></div></div'
