 b"ayers of Bluetspur (see chapter 3) could find no cure for their overlord's a"
 b'ffliction, their degenerating elder brain turned to radical methods to stave'
 b' off dementia and death. The results were vampiric mind flayers, feral atroc'
 b'ities spawned from mind flayer tadpoles infected with vampirism. These speci'
 b'alized but flawed terrors serve a single purpose: to drain the cerebral flui'
 b'ds from sapient minds. After doing so, they return to the Elder Brain of Blu'
 b'etspur, which liquefies them into its pool and releases their stolen essence'
 b"s amid a hormone brine. This grotesque balm stalls the elder brain's degener"
 b'ation but is far from a cure.</p><p>Vampiric mind flayers are physically and'
 b' mentally unstable beings. Ghoulish creatures, they let nothing stand betwee'
 b'n them and their existential imperatives. Although they possess the telepath'
 b"ic abilities of mind flayers, their brains aren't equipped to employ them. I"
 b'nstead, they bombard nearby creatures with a mental static of visceral visio'
 b'ns. While these ravenous creatures are horrifying to behold, they unsettle n'
 b'one more than other mind flayers, which consider them abominations.</p></div'
