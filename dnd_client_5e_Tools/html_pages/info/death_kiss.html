 b'at might come into being when a beholder has a vivid nightmare about losing '

 b'er that dreamed it into existence, but its hue is more muted.</p><div class='

 b'blood, which it uses to generate electrical energy inside its body. Paranoid'
 b' about dying from starvation, it obsessively drains even little creatures su'
 b'ch as rats in an effort to stave off this fate for as long as possible. Afte'
 b'r it drains its prey, it abandons the corpse to scavengers. A death kiss pre'
 b'fers to hunt alone. If it meets another death kiss, it might fight, flee, or'
 b' team up, depending on its health and pride. When underground, it uses its t'
 b'entacles as feelers, prodding and examining the environment in all direction'
 b's. Above ground, it usually keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, '
 b'then lashes out and extends them to their full length to catch opponents off'
 b' guard.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd'

 b'ng and with its tentacles extended, a death kiss can be mistaken for a true '
 b'beholder. It might purposely present itself as a beholder to an ignorant cre'
 b'ature, but this behavior is rare, since it usually is focused on hunting and'
 b' lacks the self-importance and paranoia of a true beholder. It can speak thr'
 b'ough any of its tentacle-throats, and its voice sounds nasal and high-pitche'
 b'd. A true beholder has little to fear from a death kiss, since it can easily'
 b' kill or subdue the death kiss long before the death kiss gets into melee ra'
 b'nge. Thus, out of self-preservation, a death kiss usually submits to the rul'
 b'e of a beholder that it encounters, though it might attempt to escape as soo'
 b'n as its master is preoccupied.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></'

 b'</span> <p> A death kiss lacks the combat finesse and intelligence of a beho'
 b'lder. It might attempt an unusual maneuver to control its prey (such as flyi'
 b'ng up while grappling), but in most cases, it attaches one or more of its te'
 b'ntacles to a creature and drains blood until its prey collapses. If it is in'
 b' a superior position and its opponent poses no threat, it might toy with its'
 b' food, slowly squeezing and draining the life out of a creature.</p><div cla'
