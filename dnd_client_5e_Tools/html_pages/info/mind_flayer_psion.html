 b'nt creatures across countless worlds. Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdim'
 b'ensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races '
 b'for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like hea'
 b'ds, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near.</p><p>'
 b'In eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They su'
 b'bjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including t'
 b'he githyanki and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined by a c'
 b'ollective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil '
 b'as their fathomless minds can conceive.</p><p>Since the fall of their empire'
 b's, illithid collectives on the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark.'
 b' Psionic Commanders. Mind flayers possess psionic powers that enable them to'
 b' control the minds of creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, a'
 b'nd ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepa'
 b'thy when issuing commands to their thralls.</p><p>When an illithid meets str'
 b'ong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack.'
 b" Like physical extensions of the illithid's thoughts, these thralls interpos"
 b'e themselves between the mind flayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives s'
 b'o that their master can escape.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><span class="'

 b'd outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devote'
 b'd to an elder brain-a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool '
 b'near the center of a mind flayer community. From its pool, an elder brain te'
 b'lepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 mi'
 b'les of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.</p>'

 b'hey do so in Qualith. This system of tactile writing (similar to braille) is'
 b" read by an illithid's tentacles. Qualith is written in four-line stanzas an"
 b'd is so alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic to dis'
 b'cern its meaning. Though Qualith can be used to keep records, illithids most'
 b' often use it to mark portals or other surfaces with warnings or instruction'
