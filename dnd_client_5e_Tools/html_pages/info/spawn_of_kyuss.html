 b'p> From a distance or in poor light, a spawn of Kyuss looks like an ordinary'
 b' zombie. As it comes into clearer view, one can see scores of little green w'
 b'orms crawling in and out of it. These worms jump onto nearby humanoids and b'
 b'urrow into their flesh. A worm that penetrates a humanoid body makes its way'
 b" to the creature's brain. Once inside the brain, the worm kills its host and"
 b' animates the corpse, transforming it into a spawn of Kyuss that breeds more'
 b" worms. The dead humanoid's soul remains trapped inside the corpse, preventi"
 b'ng the individual from being raised or resurrected until the undead body is '
 b'destroyed. The horror of being a soul imprisoned in an undead body drives a '
 b'spawn of Kyuss insane.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div '
