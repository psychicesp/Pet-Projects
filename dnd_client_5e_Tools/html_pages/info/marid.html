Although all genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees itself as clearly superior to the flighty djinn, the ground-hugging dao, and the fuming efreet. Large and piscine, marids are a strange sight to behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests and colorful pantaloons they favor. They speak in voices as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves breaking against a rocky cliff. In flight, their lower bodies transform into columns of foamy water.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4791"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Water Lords.</span></span> <p>Water is a marid's native element, and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any "
 b'way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or shape clouds of fog and mist from the vapor in the air. It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a weapon to bludgeon its foes.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4792"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Marid Homes.</span></span> <p>Marids are rare on the Material Plane.

They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and despise efreet.</p><p>Humanoids are among the lowest of the creatures that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal is a creature that knows its place.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4794"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Whimsical Storytellers.</span></span> <p>Marids are champion tale-tellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess of marids in general and of the speaker in particular. Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren't always malicio"

Marids consider it a crime for a lesser being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a marid is a sure way to invoke its wrath.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4795"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Genies.</span></span> <p>Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story and legend.

A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.</p><p>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.</p><p>In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.</p><p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity.
