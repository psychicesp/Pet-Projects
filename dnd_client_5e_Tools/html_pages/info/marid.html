 b'ature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rar'
 b'e circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest'
 b' form and create a genie.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A gen'
 b'ie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life fo'
 b"rce is a building block that determines the genie's form and apparent gender"
 b', as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble human'
 b"oid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mat"
 b'e with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born o'
 b'ut of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A gen'
 b'ie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a chil'
 b'd with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.</p><p>When a genie perish'
 b'es, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along w'
 b'ith a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a f'
 b'lash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.</p><p>In contrast to t'
 b'heir love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A'
 b' genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All'
 b' genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also posse'
 b'ss the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often see'
 b'k to bind genies into service.</p><p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and'
 b' envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Oth'
 b'er genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it i'
 b"s to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholde"
 b'n to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble gen'
 b"ie's will and risk the consequences.</p><p>Their miraculous powers, the gran"
 b'deur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to d'
 b'eceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go s'
 b'o far as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or wor'
 b'lds-bow down before them.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="'

 b' and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a re'
