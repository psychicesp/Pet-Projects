 b' course of making this new army, the hags crafted four magic tomes and recor'
 b'ded the true names of every yugoloth they created, save one, the General of '
 b'Gehenna. These tomes were called the Books of Keeping. Since knowing a fiend'
 b"'s true name grants power over it, the hags used the books to ensure the yug"
 b"oloths' loyalty. They also used the books to capture the true names of other"
 b' fiends that crossed them. It is rumored that the Books of Keeping contain t'
 b'he true names of a few demon lords and archdevils as well.</p><div class="rd'

 b"ining a yugoloth army's loyalty typically exceeds what any warlord on the Ma"

 b'themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a ravening hor'
 b'de of demons, but far less orderly and regimented than a legion of devils. W'
 b'ithout a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight simply to ind'
 b'ulge their violent predilections, and only as long as it benefits them to do'
