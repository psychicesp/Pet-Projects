(b'<td class="text" colspan="6"><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><p>Goliath legends '
 b'speak of a creature that prowls the far reaches of Icewind Dale, known as Oy'
 b'aminartok the Winter Walker. She can take the form of either a polar bear or'
 b' a hulking, bipedal shape obscured by wind and blowing snow. Elders invoke h'
 b"er name to keep young goliaths from wandering too far from home before they'"
 b're ready. Adult goliaths sometimes encounter this legendary individual in th'
 b'eir travels to the far-flung corners of the dale. If they flee like cowards,'
 b' Oyaminartok laughs and lets them go to wander in obscurity. If they challen'
 b'ge Oyaminartok to a fight, the Winter Walker smiles and tests their mettle. '
 b'Those who impress her with their fighting skills are bitten and become golia'
 b"th werebears themselves\xe2\x80\x94goliaths who carry Oyaminartok's curse"
 b' of lycanthropy. Contrary to myth, Oyaminartok is not a monster but a force '
 b'of good in the region, and she passes her curse only to goliaths whose heart'
 b's are pure.</p><p>Oyaminartok and others of her kind try to help creatures t'
 b'hey come across, for the weather and the geography of Icewind Dale can be br'
 b'utal. They know the safest routes across the tundra, and they can help guide'
 b' travelers through the Sea of Moving Ice and across its ever-shifting ice fl'
 b'oes. These polar werebears attack evil in the wilderness, but they steer cle'
 b"ar of camps and settlements. Fire is Oyaminartok's bane, and thus she and he"
 b'r kind are wary around hearths and open flames.</p></div></td>')
