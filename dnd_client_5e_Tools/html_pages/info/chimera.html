 b'orld. The Prince of Demons, unimpressed with the creatures that surrounded i'

 b' rise to the first chimeras.</p><p>Gifted with demonic cruelty, a chimera se'
 b'rves as a grim reminder of what happens when demon princes find their way to'
 b' the Material Plane. A typical specimen has the hindquarters of a large goat'
 b', the forequarters of a lion, and the leathery wings of a dragon, along with'
 b' the heads of all three of those creatures. The monster likes to surprise it'
 b's victims, swooping down from the sky and engulfing prey with its fiery brea'
 b'th before landing.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--'

 b' three parts. Its dragon head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a g'
 b'reat hoard. Its leonine nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creature'
 b's that threaten its territory. Its goat head grants it a vicious, stubborn s'
 b'treak that compels it to fight to the death. These three aspects drive a chi'
 b'mera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on'
 b' wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and d'
 b'efeated. Its greatest rivals are dragons, griffons, manticores, perytons, an'
 b'd wyverns. When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. I'
 b't enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures. The monster often toys '
 b'with its prey, breaking off an attack prematurely and leaving a creature wou'
 b'nded and terrified before returning to finish it off.</p><div class="rd__spc'
