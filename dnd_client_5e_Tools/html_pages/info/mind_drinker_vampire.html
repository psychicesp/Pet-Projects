His secrets are passed on only to other members of his guild, and mind drinkers who leave House Dimir become enemies of the guild-the only exceptions to a rule that prohibits mind drinkers from feeding on others of their kind.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5021"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Cell Leaders.</span></span> <p>Thanks to their particular gifts, mind drinkers are often placed as leaders of small cells of covert Dimir operatives. They rarely trust their own agents, though, and often follow their cell members to make sure those members carry out missions as ordered. The most suspicious vampires might even siphon thoughts from their subordinates to detect any hint of betrayal.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5022"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Vampires.</span></span> <p>Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living.

Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.</p><div class"

They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires.
