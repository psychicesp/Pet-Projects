 b'shasas served the fiendish lords as strategists and generals. A rakshasa nam'
 b'ed Mordakhesh rose up through the ranks to become one of the greatest comman'
 b'ders of his age, and a dragon-slaying specialist. For this, he earned the ni'
 b'ckname Shadowsword, along with a legendary reputation for leaving death in h'
 b'is wake.</p><p>Mordakhesh serves as the prakhutu or "speaker" of his impriso'
 b'ned master, Rak Tulkhesh, and he seeks to free his lord by bathing the world'
 b' in blood. Like a spider with multiple webs, he has agents and pawns (which '
 b'he calls his "claws") established in armies across Khorvaire. The most signi'
 b'ficant of those is the barbarian horde he amasses in the Demon Waste'
 b's\xe2\x80\x94warriors who threaten to sweep into Aundair on a tide of blo'
 b'od.</p><p>Many of the horrors of the Last War were instigated\xe2\x80\x94'
 b"or at least encouraged\xe2\x80\x94by Mordakhesh's operatives, and his cla"
 b'ws are known to have perpetrated some of the most brutal massacres of that c'
 b"onflict. No one knows how far the Shadowsword's reach extends, or which comm"
 b'anders in the armies of Khorvaire serve him.</p></div></div></td>')
