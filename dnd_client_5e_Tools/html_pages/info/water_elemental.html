 b'On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousn'
 b'ess manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A'
 b' wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the e'
 b'lement of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these element'
 b'al spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.</p><div cl'
