Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8492"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Conjured by Magic.</span></span> <p>Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane.
