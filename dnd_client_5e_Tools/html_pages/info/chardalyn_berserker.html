This exposure has transformed them into fiends. They shed their heavier protective clothing and embrace the frigid cold, allowing frostbite to ravage the exposed parts of their bodies, with only their faith in the Frostmaiden keeping them alive.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="607"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Chardalyn Weapons.</span></span> <p>A chardalyn berserker wields one or more weapons made wholly or partly out of chardalyn that has been tainted by demonic magic. Battleaxes, flails, javelins, and spears are favored weapons, though other weapons are possible.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A character who claims one or more of these weapons can be corrupted by them.

If the berserker's madness is cured using magic that removes the effects of madness, the berserker loses its Chardalyn Madness trait but retains its chaotic evil alignment and other qualities. Further exposure to the demonic magic causes the berserker\'s madness to return, however.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>')
