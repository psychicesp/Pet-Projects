 b'ically erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the '

 b'vines. For all other creatures, the area becomes difficult terrain, and each'
 b' creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be re'
 b'strained by the roots. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or an'
 b'other creature within its reach, doing so with a successful DC 19 Strength ('
 b'Athletics) check. The roots and vines wilt away when the lich uses this lair'
 b' action again or when the lich dies.</li></ul></div></div></td>')
