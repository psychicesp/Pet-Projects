 b' Devastation identifies hobgoblins with a talent for magic and puts them thr'

 b'n> <p> While other cultures treat their wizards as cloistered academics, hob'
 b'goblins expect their spellcasters to fight. Devastators learn the basics of '
 b'weapon use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies defeated though thei'
 b'r magic.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Devastators have the r'
 b'espect of other members of the host, and they receive obedience and deferenc'
 b'e from many quarters. Their ability to lay waste to entire formations with a'
 b' single use of magic allows them to gain far more glory in battle than a sin'
 b'gle warrior.</p><p>Other cultures might view the use of such abilities as a '
 b'short cut to glory, but to hobgoblins a gift for magic is as valued and usef'
 b'ul as a strong sword arm or brilliance in tactics. They are all boons from M'
 b'aglubiyet that must be cultivated and unleashed upon the enemy.</p><p>The Ac'
 b'ademy of Devastation believes that an academic approach to magic is a sign o'
 b"f weakness and inefficiency. A warrior doesn't need to know about metallurgy"
 b' to wield a blade, so why should a wizard care about where magic comes from?'
 b' Devastators love to prove their superiority in battle by seeking out enemy '
 b'spellcasters and destroying them.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span'
