 b'g-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be "great wyrms" mor'
 b'e than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end'
 b' of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. T'
 b'his vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can w'
 b'in battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties o'

 b'n> <p>Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for tr'
 b'ap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which th'
 b'ey move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their '
 b'lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazard'
 b's and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap tha'
 b't hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous g'
 b'iant centipedes at intruders.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></di'

 b"named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in"
 b' the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket f'
 b"rom the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket,"

 b"lds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers "
 b'dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-'
