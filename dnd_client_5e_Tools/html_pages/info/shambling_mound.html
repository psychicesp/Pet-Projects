Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures. Rather, they remain in place, sustaining themselves by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings as they wait for prey to come to them. When a creature passes near or alights upon a shambling mound, the monster comes to life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6840"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Spawned by Lightning.</span></span> <p> A shambling mound results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it, mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots eventually give up their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out new sources of food.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6841"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">The Weed that Walks.</span></span> <p>The instinct that drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere inside its ponderous form.
