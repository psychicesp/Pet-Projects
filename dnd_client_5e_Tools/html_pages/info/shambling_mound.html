 b"Only the shambling mounds' rarity and plodding speed prevent them from overw"
 b'helming entire ecosystems. Even so, their presence leeches natural environme'
 b'nts of plant and animal life, and an unsettling quiet pervades the swamps an'
 b'd woods haunted by these ever-hungry horrors.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-'

 b'lant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and anim'
 b'als around it, mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those root'
