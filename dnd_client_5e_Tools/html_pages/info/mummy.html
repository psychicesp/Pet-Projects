 b"The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its"
 b" body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs a"
 b're removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preser'
 b'ving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corps'
 b'e is typically wrapped in linen bandages.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post'

 b'death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necroma'
 b"ntic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic marki"
 b'ngs before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a '
 b'mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by'
 b' the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lan'
 b'ds, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.</p><div class="rd__spc-'

 b'duals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of tr'
 b'eason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal und'
 b'eath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as t'
