 b'aving no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs in'
 b'terfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten '
 b"knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't"

 b'ies to come to fruition.</p><p>A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with '
 b'withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay'
 b' long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed'

 b' whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards '
 b'that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul e'
 b'ntities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has create'
 b'd countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always '
 b'demand fealty and service for their knowledge.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline'

 b"ard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world,"
 b' preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery '
 b'is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the '
 b'form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of na'
 b'ming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.</p><p>With'
 b' its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-'
 b'a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whos'
 b'e soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as'
 b' a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.<'

 b' its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for th'

 b'nd a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any'
 b' creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for '
 b'24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divin'
