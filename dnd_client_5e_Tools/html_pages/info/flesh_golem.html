 b'ched and bolted together into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strengt'
 b'h. Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more so'
 b"phisticated than those of a young child. The golem's muscle tissue responds "
 b'to the power of lightning, invigorating the creature with vitality and stren'
 b"gth. Powerful enchantments protect the golem's skin, deflecting spells and a"
 b'll but the most potent weapons.</p><p>A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-joi'
 b"nted gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn't a"
 b'n ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherentl'
 b"y to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator's will, the "
 b'golem goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or'
 b' completely healed.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h-'

 b'd it protects or attacks as that creator demands.</p><div class="rd__spc-inl'

 b'lding of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonec'
 b"utting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem's creator is the master o"
 b'f the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master a'
 b'rtisans to do the work.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>After c'
 b"onstructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem's creator i"
 b'nfuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark o'
 b'f life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to m'
 b'ove and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subje'
 b"cts it to the will of the golem's creator.</p><p>A golem can be created with"
 b' a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to con'
 b'trol the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to'
 b" serve a new master.</p><p>A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it "
