 b'vil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil'
 b' can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil re'
 b'tains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion '
 b'is excessive.</p><p>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has no'
 b"t sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's"
