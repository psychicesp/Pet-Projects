Any good hit from a bludgeoning or slashing weapon severs part of the zombie's body. Strahd zombies are suffused with horrible necromantic magic that allows their severed body parts to continue to attack. All parts of a Strahd zombie are considered one and the same creature, so damage to any part damages the whole creature.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7426"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>A Strahd zombie doesn\'t require air or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>')
