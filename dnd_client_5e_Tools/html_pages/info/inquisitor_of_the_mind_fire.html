 b'ywhere. With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we'
 b' will annihilate it." With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed '
 b'founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks t'
 b"o discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls.</p><p>In the days before"
 b' Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across'
 b' the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powe'
 b'rs that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose a'
 b'gain. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations'
 b', and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the pr'
 b'iests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at hi'
 b"s friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of "
 b'focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can '
 b'corrupt a person.</p><p>Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian or'
 b'ganized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a t'
 b'ype of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fir'
 b'e\xe2\x80\x94their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each p'
 b"erson's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and d"
 b'ominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected th'
 b'emselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower t'
 b'heir own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisitio'
 b'n, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use '
 b"intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order'"
 b"s members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.</p><p>To"
 b'day the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the nor'
 b"th of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members through"
 b'out the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherwor'
 b'ldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this'
 b' work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where fo'
 b'lk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fi'
 b'ends the inquisitors originally hunted.</p></div></td>')
