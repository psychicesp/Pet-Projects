A master can have only one homunculus at a time (attempts to create another one always fail), and when its master dies, the homunculus also dies.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3638"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Shared Mind.</span></span> <p>A homunculus knows everything its creator knows, including all the languages the creator can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct senses is known to its master, even over great distances, provided both are on the same plane. Functioning as a spy, a scout, an emissary, or a messenger, a homunculus is an invaluable servant for a spellcaster engaged in secret experimentation or adventuring.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
