 b'be devoured.</p><p>The peryton is a bizarre creature that blends the body an'
 b'd wings of a bird of prey with the head of a stag. Its strangest feature is '
 b"its shadow, which appears humanoid rather than reflecting the creature's phy"
 b'sical form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were humans transformed '
 b'by a hideous curse or magical experiment, but bards tell a different tale of'
 b' a man whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the heart of her '
 b'younger, more beautiful rival and consume it in a ritual intended to forever'
 b" win her husband's heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman's villainy wa"
 b's exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the lingering magic of her foul'
 b' ritual caused the carrion birds that feasted on her corpse to transform int'
 b'o the first perytons.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__'
