 b'lling the prophecy mortals believed into being. After doing so, these terror'

 b' owe their existence not to Nyx and the dreams of mortals, but to natural fo'
 b'rces in the land. As a result, Theran giants are typically infused with the '
 b'elements they embody, which might manifest as flaming beards, frozen skin, h'
 b'air crackling with lightning, or other primal incarnations.</p><p>Beyond the'
