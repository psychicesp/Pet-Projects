Dim-witted, the zaratan lurches onward, expressing its rage through its trumpeting calls and the occasional boulder or blast of debris it spews from its cavernous maw. If seriously injured, the zaratan slowly retracts its appendages to gain shelter beneath its impervious shell, biding its time until it recovers and can resume its march.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="9334"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Elder Elementals.</span></span> <p>On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape.

Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="9336"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Elemental Nature.</span></span> <p>An elder elemental doesn\'t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
