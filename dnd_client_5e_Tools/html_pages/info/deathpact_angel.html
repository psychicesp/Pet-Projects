Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild.

They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter).</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Debts Paid</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1126"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Orzhov Angels.</span></span> <p>Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings.
