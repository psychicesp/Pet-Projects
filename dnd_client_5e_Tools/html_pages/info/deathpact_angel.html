 b'tioners who beg the angel for blessings: wealth, prestige, health, revenge, '
 b'and the like. Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually trie'
 b's to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing fr'
 b'om its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild.'
 b" True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gi"
 b'fts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe'
 b' it life debts.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="'

 b'with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the an'
 b'gel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly of'
