They can consume any living creature, but they are especially drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature's shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>If a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its "parent" to vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no longer casts one until the monster is destroyed.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6758"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>A shadow doesn\'t require air, food, drink, or sleep</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
