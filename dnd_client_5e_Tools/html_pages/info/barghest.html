 b'goblinoid gods, bargained with the General of Gehenna for aid. The General p'
 b'rovided yugoloths that died to serve the cause of the goblin god. Yet when t'
 b'he time came to honor his part of the compact, Maglubiyet reneged on the dea'
 b'l. As an act of vengeance, the General of Gehenna created the soul-devouring'
 b' barghests to devour goblinoid souls and deprive Maglubiyet of troops for hi'
 b's army in the afterlife.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div clas'

 b'A barghest is born to goblin parents just as normal offspring are. The creat'
 b'ure emerges in the form of a goblin, then develops the ability to assume its'
 b' true form: that of a large, fiendish canine.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-'
 b'post"></div><p>The mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General'
 b' of Gehenna, is to consume seventeen goblinoid souls by devouring the bodies'
 b' of those it kills. Souls consumed in this way are prevented from joining Ma'
 b"glubiyet's forces in Acheron. Why seventeen? Because the oaths Maglubiyet br"
 b'oke in his compact with the General totaled seventeen.</p><p>A barghest hung'
 b'ers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and ser'
 b"ve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn't kill goblino"
 b'ids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other '
 b'powerful individuals, rather than lowly goblins, a barghest earns elevated s'
 b'tatus in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, p'
 b'reying upon a goblin or two when the opportunity arises, until they reach ad'
 b'ult age and are old and strong enough to seek out stronger prey. When goblin'
 b's discover that a barghest is among them, they react with groveling obeisanc'
 b"e, each member of the tribe eager to show the barghest that it isn't worthy "
 b'of being devoured.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h r'
