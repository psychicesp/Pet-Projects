 b'ering 14 feet tall. Yeenoghu is the Gnoll Lord, and his creations are made i'
 b'n his twisted image. When the demon lord hunted across the Material Plane, p'
 b"acks of hyenas followed in his wake. Those that ate of great Yeenoghu's kill"
 b"s became gnolls, emulating their master's ways. Few others worship the Beast"
 b' of Butchery, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunched '
 b'over, and filing their teeth down to points.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-p'

 b'uction. The gnolls are his instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater a'
 b'trocities in his name. Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death,'
 b" and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things. He doesn'"
 b't parlay; to meet him is to do battle with him\xe2\x80\x94unless he becom'
 b'es bored. The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalry with Baphomet, the Horned'
 b' King, and the two demon lords and their followers attack one another on sig'
 b'ht.</p><p>The Gnoll Lord is covered in matted fur and taut, leathery hide, h'
 b"is face like a grinning predator's skull. Patchwork armor made of discarded "
 b'shields and breastplates is lashed onto his body with heavy chains, decorate'
 b'd by the flayed skins of his foes. He wields a triple-headed flail called th'
 b'e Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as like'
 b'ly to tear his prey apart with his bare hands before ripping out its throat '
 b'with his teeth.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__'
