 b'ills with horror at the realization that the noise is drawing closer. When h'

 b' also be found on most of the Lower Planes, because of the many fiends that '
 b'capture them and train them as war hounds. Howlers can be domesticated, afte'
 b'r a fashion, but they respond only to brutal training during which they are '
 b"forced to recognize the trainer as the pack's undisputed leader. A trained p"
 b'ack then follows its leader without hesitation. Howler packs course over the'
 b' battlefields of the Blood War and also serve evil mortals who have the powe'
 b'r and the savagery to command their loyalty.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-p'

 b'ng howl to corner prey before they tear it apart. The howl floods the minds '
 b'of its victims, making complex thought impossible. They can do little more t'
 b'han stare in horror and stumble around the battlefield in a search for safet'
 b'y. Any task more demanding than that is beyond their capability. Fiends espe'
 b'cially prize howlers for this reason, because for a few crucial moments in a'
 b" battle, their howls can neutralize an enemy's ability to use spells and oth"
 b'er powers.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
