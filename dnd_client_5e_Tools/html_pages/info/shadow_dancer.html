 b'as similar to fighting a living darkness. Every dim alcove and darkened nook'
 b' is a place from where the lithe and acrobatic shadow dancers can emerge to '
 b'ambush their prey. Using this tactic, they attack their enemies from all ang'
 b'les with a flurry of entangling chains that hold fast and corrupt the flesh.'
 b' When their quarry is helpless, others move in to help dispatch the prey. Th'
 b'en they loot the corpse for trinkets, anything colorful and lively to gaze a'
 b't after they return to the gloom of the Shadowfell.</p><div class="rd__spc-i'
