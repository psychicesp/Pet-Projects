 b'irit bound by a sacred oath to safeguard a place of import to the divine. Fo'
 b'rged from the souls of those who had proven their unwavering devotion, eidol'
 b'ons stalk temples and vaults, places where miracles have been witnessed and '
 b'relics enshrined, to ensure that no enemy can gain a foothold against the go'
 b"ds' cause through defilement or violence within these sites. If an enemy wit"
 b'h such intent sets foot inside a warded location, the eidolon plunges into a'
 b' graven vessel, a statue specially prepared to house the souls of these prot'
 b'ectors. The eidolon then animates the effigy and uses the borrowed body to d'
 b'rive out the intruders bent on plundering the relics it is charged with guar'
 b'ding.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__'
