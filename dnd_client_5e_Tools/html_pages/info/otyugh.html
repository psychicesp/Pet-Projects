 b'sturdy legs, its eyes and nose set along a vine. Like stalk that snakes from'
 b' the top of its bloated body. Two rubbery tentacles end in spiky, leaf-like '
 b'appendages that the otyugh uses to shovel food into its gaping maw.</p><p>An'
 b' otyugh buries itself under mounds of offal and carrion, leaving only its se'
 b"nsory stalk exposed. When an edible creature happens by, the otyugh's tentac"
 b'les erupt from the filth and grab hold of it.</p><p>Otyughs make the most of'
 b' any opportunity to ambush and devour prey. They use a limited form of telep'
 b'athy to urge sentient creatures toward their lairs, sometimes by pretending '
 b'to be something else.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__'

 b'en considerable stores of carrion or garbage lie within reach. In the wilder'
 b'ness, they dwell in stagnant swamps, scum-filled ponds, and damp forest dell'
 b's. The scent of graveyards, city sewers, village middens, and manure-filled '
 b'animal pens attracts them to civilized areas.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-'

 b'xist with otyughs, employing them as garbage disposals. With such plentiful '
 b'sustenance, otyughs grow fat in their wallows, unmoved by any other drive or'
 b' desire. This sedentary gluttony makes them reliable guardians. As long as i'
 b't is fed, an otyugh refrains from attacking other creatures. However, would-'
 b'be otyugh masters can easily underestimate the quantity of waste, carrion, a'
 b'nd meat necessary to keep an otyugh from wandering off in search of food. Mo'
 b're than one "trained" otyugh has eaten its keeper after devouring all the wa'
 b'ste in its wallow.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></d'
