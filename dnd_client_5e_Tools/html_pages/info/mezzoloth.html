 b'urse of making this new army, the hags crafted four magic tomes and recorded'
 b' the true names of every yugoloth they created, save one, the General of Geh'
 b"enna. These tomes were called the Books of Keeping. Since knowing a fiend's "
 b'true name grants power over it, the hags used the books to ensure the yugolo'
 b"ths' loyalty. They also used the books to capture the true names of other fi"
 b'ends that crossed them. It is rumored that the Books of Keeping contain the '

 b'mselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a ravening horde '
 b'of demons, but far less orderly and regimented than a legion of devils. With'
 b'out a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight simply to indulg'
