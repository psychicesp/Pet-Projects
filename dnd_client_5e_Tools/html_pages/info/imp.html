 b're typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into'

 b'lmost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes it'
 b'self in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves'
 b'. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy o'
 b'f infernal forms.</p><p>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or '
 b'disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a les'
 b'ser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An arc'
 b'hdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted de'
 b'vil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the dem'
 b'otion is excessive.</p><p>No devil can promote or demote another devil that '
 b'has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each o'
 b"ther's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he"
 b' can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal f'
