 b"or, the hexton's machine must be fed something that identifies the predator'"
 b's target, such as a lock of hair, a well-worn glove, or a much-used weapon. '
 b'The moment the newly manufactured steel predator emerges, it bounds away in '
 b'search of its prey. It senses the location of its target across planar bound'
 b'aries, but such detection is accurate only to within a thousand yards; to cl'
 b'ose the remaining distance, the steel predator locates its prey by sight and'
 b' smell.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Once battle is joined, '
 b'the predator ignores every other threat to attack its target, unless other c'
 b'reatures prevent it from reaching the target. In that case, it does what it '

 b'ator to linger in the area, hunting and killing other creatures that resembl'
