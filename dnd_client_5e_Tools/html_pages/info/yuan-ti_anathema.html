This ritual demands the sacrifice of hundreds of snakes and requires the abomination to bathe in the blood of its enemies. The transformation is quick yet painful.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Not all yuan-ti are eager to see one of their own become an anathema, since anathemas brutally subjugate their lessers for their own evil ends.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="9164"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Not Quite Divine.</span></span> <p> An anathema considers itself a demigod on the path to greater divinity. It demands obeisance from weaker yuan-ti and uses every resource at its disposal to launch small-scale wars against its neighbors. Each conquest brings new slaves and sacrifices, as well as glory and riches, that the anathema thinks it needs to achieve true divinity.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>An anathema\'s most loyal yuan-ti followers see it as the pinnacle of the serpentine form, an unbelievable improvement on the nearly perfect abomination. Its devoted human followers think of it as "divine flesh in a mortal body," and cultists serving an anathema tend to be more bloodthirsty and self-sacrificing in its presence.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="9165"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Immortal.</span></span> <p> Anathemas don't age, allowing them to pursue their goals until the end of days. Truly powerful ones can grow to rule multiple yuan-ti cities and bring entire regions, including humanoid realms, under yuan-ti control.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>')
