Through dark magic, these components take on an enormous and vile humanoid shape, resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1063"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Birthed by Hags.</span></span> <p> In the earliest days of the world, a coven of night hags devised a ritual that led to the creation of the first banderhobb. A hag that knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other dark fey and powerful fiends also know of the process, as do a few mortal mages. Instructions might also be found in a tome devoted to debased wizardry.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Legends tell of a dark tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform, and banderhobbs roam.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1064"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Silent and Deadly.</span></span> <p> When the ritual to create a banderhobb is complete, flesh, spirit, and shadow combine to produce a creature as big as an ogre. The newly formed monstrosity has spindly limbs that belie great strength. Its broad maw holds a long tongue and rows of fangs, both of which it uses to grab and swallow a creature or perhaps an object the banderhobb intends to steal. Despite its size, a banderhobb makes little noise, moving as silently as the shadows that infuse it. A banderhobb isn't capable of speech, but it can understand orders given to it by its creator and communicates with nearby banderhobbs in a psychic manner.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1065"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Agents of Evil.</span></span> <p> During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out the bidding of the one who birthed it. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or creates. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or other object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>
