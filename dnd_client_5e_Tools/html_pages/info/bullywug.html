 b'f the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders '
 b'and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styl'
 b'ed lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titl'
 b'es, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superior'
 b's, and endlessly vie to win their superiors\' favor.</p><div class="rd__s'

 b'It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its crimi'
 b'nal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as '
 b'tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its ri'
 b"vals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bully"
 b'wugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of secur'
 b'ing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invar'
 b'iably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and negle'
 b'ct. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its'
 b' subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__'
