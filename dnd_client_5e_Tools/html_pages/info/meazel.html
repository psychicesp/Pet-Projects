Merely stepping into one pool of darkness allows a meazel to move to another one. They use this talent to ambush creatures, snatching them around the throat with their strangling cords and then stepping away. Meazels also use this ability to ferry their victims to isolated spots and then leave the hapless souls to the designs of whatever horrors lurk there.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Creatures that are drawn through the shadows by meazels are cursed by the meazels' baleful magic.
