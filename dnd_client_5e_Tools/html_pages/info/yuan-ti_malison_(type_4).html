 b'humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpen'
 b"ts as totem animals. They lauded the serpent's sinuous flexibility, its calc"

 b'r higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent '
 b'gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness'
 b' as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more '
 b'fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serp'
 b'ent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacr'
 b'ifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrifici'
 b'ng their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in tho'
 b"ught and emotion.</p><p>Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can't "
 b'be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to ser'
 b've. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of'
 b' wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake '
 b'of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or l'
 b'ends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.</p><'
