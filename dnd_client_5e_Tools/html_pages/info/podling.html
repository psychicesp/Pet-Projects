<td class="text" colspan="6"><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><p>Bodytaker plants either capture unsuspecting victims with their vines or accept captives brought to them by their podling servants. In either case, they drag creatures into their central pod, where potent chemicals render the captive comatose. Over the course of hours, the creature is dissolved and its body repurposed into a podling duplicate.</p><p>Podlings are near-perfect mimics of the creatures they replace. Despite having the knowledge of those they mimic, podlings frequently miss the nuances of interactions between sapient beings. These duplicates make excuses about their odd behavior, but those familiar with an individual replaced by a podling can often tell something's amiss. Roll on the Podling Behavior table to see what unusual habits a podling might demonstrate.</p><table class="rd__table stripe-odd-table"><caption>Podling Behavior</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" data-packed-dice=\'{"type":"dice","rollable":true,"toRoll":"d6"}\' onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" title="Click to roll.
