 b'le objects as kindling for a grand conflagration, and only the magical contr'
 b'ol exerted by their summoners keeps them from setting everything they touch '
 b'ablaze. Their propensity for fire and havoc makes them ideal for spreading c'
 b'haos and destruction. A mob of magmins summoned inside a castle can reduce i'
 b't to a burning shell within minutes. </p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></'
