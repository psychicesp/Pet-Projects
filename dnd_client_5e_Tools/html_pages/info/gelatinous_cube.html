 b"reatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a"
 b' location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around '
 b'to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed in'
 b'to a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from com'
 b'ing after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strat'
 b'egic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.</p>'
