 b'ent. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creat'
 b'ing populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is '
 b'a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduc'
 b't their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and k'
 b'eep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as th'

 b'ch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class="r'
