 b' vegetation, eating the occasional bit of carrion, and wallowing in mire. A '
 b'catoblepas might be found with the one mate it chooses for life and, on occa'

 b's say that gods of pestilence and rot created catoblepases as embodiments of'
 b' their influence. Whatever the origin of the creature, stories link the cato'
 b'blepas to misfortune, and many of these yarns have elements of truth. Some s'
 b'uch tales claim that hags tend catoblepases like cattle, and that a swamp th'
 b'at contains a catoblepas might also be home to a hag that drinks the monster'
 b"'s milk. Although a particular catoblepas might not be linked to a hag, a co"
 b'ven of hags might keep one or more of these beasts as guardians or pets. Oth'
 b'er legends say that those of impure heart can tame a catoblepas. Indeed, som'
 b'e tales have circulated of malevolent warlocks and dark knights who have dis'
 b'covered how to domesticate the beasts and use them as mounts.</p></div><div '

 b' When it is on the attack, a catoblepas reveals the extent of its horrific n'
 b"ature. The creature's serpentine neck has trouble lifting its head, but one "
 b'glare from its bloodshot eyes can rot flesh. At the end of its tail is a clu'
 b'b that can rattle body and soul if it strikes true, leaving a victim unable '
 b'to act. If the target of its attacks dies, the catoblepas feasts on the fres'
