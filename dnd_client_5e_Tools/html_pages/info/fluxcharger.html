As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2342"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Elemental Nature.</span></span> <p>An Izzet weird doesn\'t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>')
