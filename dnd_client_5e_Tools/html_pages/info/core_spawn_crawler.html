 b'f heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the Elder Evils, awak'
 b'ened in the depths by the cataclysmic actions of the Betrayer Gods and their'
 b' minions. They often appear on the surface world in the wake of seismic even'
 b'ts, such as that which created the bottomless Miskath Pit of Eastern Wynandi'
 b'r. Warlocks and cultists sometimes gather together to hasten the arrival of '
 b'core spawn to the Material Plane, focusing their arcane power on areas of na'
 b'tural seismic instability when the signs and stars are right.</p></div></div'
