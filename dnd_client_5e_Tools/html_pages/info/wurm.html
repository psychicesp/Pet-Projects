 b'le limbless, wingless dragons. They burrow through the earth and eat virtual'
 b'ly anything they come across, and their movement accounts for much of the de'
 b'struction in the rubblebelt regions of Ravnica. A wurm burrows through loose'
 b' earth by using deep sonic vibrations to liquefy the earth in front of it an'
 b'd swim through the area. The soil resolidifies and closes behind it. Moving '
 b'through rock is slower and more difficult, and the wurm leaves a tunnel in i'
 b'ts wake. The Gruul Clans appreciate the devastation wurms can create, and th'
 b'e clans sometimes lure them into civilized areas where the destruction can b'
 b'e vast.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
