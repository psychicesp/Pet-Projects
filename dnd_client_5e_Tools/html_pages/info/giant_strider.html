 b' sluggish, mentally and physically, after spending a week away from an exter'
 b'nal source of moist heat. A prolonged lack of heat can shut down a firenewt '
 b'community, as the creatures within go into hibernation and their eggs stop d'
 b'eveloping.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Firenewts delve for '
 b'sources of heat in the earth, such as boiling mud and hot springs, that make'
 b' ideal places to settle. Through excavation and mining in the area, they fas'
 b'hion living space and obtain an ample supply of minerals for other uses, suc'
 b'h as smelting, smithing, and alchemy. A firenewt lair features a network of '
 b'channels and sluices to circulate hot liquid through the settlement.</p><p>T'
 b'he alchemy practiced by firenewts focuses on fire. One of their favorite mix'
 b'tures is a paste of sulfur, mineral salts, and oil. Firenewts chew this blen'
 b'd habitually, because doing so produces a pleasant internal heat and it enab'
 b'les a firenewt to vomit forth a small ball of flame. Most firenewts carry a '
 b'container with this mixture in it.</p><p>Warlocks of Imix command warriors t'
 b'o prove their worth by going on raids to bring back treasure and captives. T'
 b'he warlocks take the choicest loot as a tithe to Imix, and then those who pa'
 b'rticipated in the raid divide the rest according to merit. Prisoners that ha'
 b've no apparent usefulness are sacrificed to Imix and then eaten. Those that '
 b'are deemed capable of mining and performing other chores around the lair are'
 b' kept as slaves for a while before meeting the same fate.</p><p>When firenew'
 b'ts muster for war, rather than merely staging occasional raids, they take no'
 b' prisoners. Their goal is nothing less than the annihilation of their fo'
 b'es\xe2\x80\x94and they reserve their greatest animosity for others of the'
 b"ir kind. If two groups of firenewts come upon each other, it's likely that t"
 b"hey're in competition for the same territory, and a bloody battle is the usu"
 b'al result.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3"'
