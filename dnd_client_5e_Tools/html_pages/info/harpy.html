 b'> <p>Long ago, an elf wandering a forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesom'
 b'e that she was moved to tears. Following the music, she came upon a clearing'
 b" where stood a handsome elf youth who had also paused to hear the bird's son"
 b'g. This was Fenmarel Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence sto'
 b'le her heart as he fled, vanishing into the woods as if he was never there.<'
 b'/p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Though the elf searched the woo'
 b'ds and called for her stranger, she found no sign of his passage. Driven to '
 b'despair by her longing, she begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf'
 b" goddess of the sky, heard the elf's cries and was moved to her aid. She app"
 b'eared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that'
 b' song of beauty and seduction to the elf.</p><p>When her singing failed to d'
 b'raw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a drea'
 b'dful power and transforming her into the first harpy. The curse worked its m'
 b"agic on the elf's spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love in"
 b'to a hunger for flesh, even as her beautiful song continued to draw creature'
 b's to her deadly embrace.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="r'

 b'usic more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler that succumb'
 b's to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward it'
 b's source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more eff'
 b'ective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand,'
 b' or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy ta'
 b'rgets for the harpy\'s wrath.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><'

 b'an></span> <p>Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous '
 b'to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and they '
 b'never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a '
 b'harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than'
 b' risk straight-up combat.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>When '
 b'they attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the "music" their v'
 b'ictims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless f'
 b'oe and can spend days torturing a victim before the merciful end.</p></div><'
