A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy\'s wrath.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3460"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Sadistic Cowards.</span></span> <p>Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures.
