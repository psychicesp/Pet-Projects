They come in six varieties, each one representing the mixture of two elements.</p><p>Ageless tricksters, mephits gather in large numbers on the Elemental Planes and in the Elemental Chaos. They also find their way to the Material Plane, where they prefer to dwell in places where their base elements are abundant. For example, a magma mephit is composed of earth and fire, and it favors volcanic lairs, while an ice mephit, which is composed of air and water, favors frigid locales.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5174"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Elemental Nature.</span></span> <p>A mephit doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><span class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="5175"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mud Mephit</span></span> <div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><p>Mud mephits are slow, unctuous creatures of earth and water.
