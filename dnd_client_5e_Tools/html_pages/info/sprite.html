 b'spotted, the sprites lead them astray with ominous rustling from the bushes '
 b'and distant snapping twigs. Creatures foolish enough to persist in intruding'
 b" on a sprite's territory are stung with poisoned arrows and lulled into a se"
 b'nseless sleep. While they slumber, the sprites make good their escape, retre'
 b'ating to an even more secluded area of the forest.</p><div class="rd__spc-in'
