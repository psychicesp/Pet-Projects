 b'h a wingspan of 3 feet.</p><p>Thought to be the results of wizardly experime'
 b'ntation on house cats, tressym are intelligent and have been known to form s'
 b'trong friendships with humanoids, particularly rangers and wizards. Tressym '
 b'get along well with others of their kind, but they rarely lair or hunt toget'
 b'her. They peacefully ignore bats, faerie dragons, and the like, but they hat'
 b'e stirges and evil flying monsters such as manticores. They also enjoy teasi'
 b'ng dogs.</p><p>Tressym feed on small rodents, birds, and insects, stalking a'
 b'nd pouncing on prey much as normal cats do, but with the added advantage of '
 b"flight. Tressym don't, however, attack nestlings or despoil eggs.</p><p>Tres"
 b"sym mate with others of their kind, but they don't mate for life. A tressym "
 b'can also mate with a normal cat, though only one out of every ten of their o'
 b'ffspring will be a tressym; the others will be normal cats.</p><p>Tressym ha'
