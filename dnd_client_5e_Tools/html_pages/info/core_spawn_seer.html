 b'The aberrant creatures known as core spawn are a subterranean breed of heral'
 b'ds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the Elder Evils, awakened in'
 b' the depths by the cataclysmic actions of the Betrayer Gods and their minion'
 b's. They often appear on the surface world in the wake of seismic events, suc'
 b'h as that which created the bottomless Miskath Pit of Eastern Wynandir. Warl'
 b'ocks and cultists sometimes gather together to hasten the arrival of core sp'
 b'awn to the Material Plane, focusing their arcane power on areas of natural s'
 b'eismic instability when the signs and stars are right.</p></div></div></td>')
