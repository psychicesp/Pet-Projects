 b' Zegana is the merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She upholds the tra'
 b'ditional ways of the guild and its utopian philosophy, which espouses a visi'
 b'on of an ideal world in which nature and civilization coexist in perfect bal'
 b'ance. Some people in the guild-members of the Adaptationist faction in parti'
 b'cular-argue that her ways are outdated and the guild requires more practical'
 b' leadership. In response, Zegana maintains that she serves as prime speaker '
 b"only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Chamber, and if the other speakers w"
 b'ish to replace her, they are certainly within their rights to do so.</p><div'
