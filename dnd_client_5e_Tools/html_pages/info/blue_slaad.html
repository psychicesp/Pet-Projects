 b'ng ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically c'
 b'omplex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, '
 b'believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and ha'
 b"lt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became"
 b' possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, t'
 b"o create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen sid"
 b'e effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that '
 b"came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the "
 b'Spawning Stone for this reason.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p'
