 b'y find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures'
 b' that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga en'
 b'counters one or more humanoids, its curiosity sometimes gets the better of i'
 b't, and it shadows those creatures for a short time to observe them. If it ta'
 b'kes a liking to a particular humanoid, a chwinga might use its cantrips to a'
 b'id it, or might bestow a magical gift before departing. The features that at'
 b'tract a chwinga to a particular humanoid can vary. In some cases, a chwinga '
 b'might simply like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair. Oth'
 b"er times, it might be smitten by a humanoid's ability to play music or to ea"
 b't copious amounts of food.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><'
