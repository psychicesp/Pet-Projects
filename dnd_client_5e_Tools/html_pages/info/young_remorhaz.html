 b"r creatures sharing their territory. They can't tolerate warm weather, havin"

 b' When hunting, a remorhaz burrows deep below the snow and ice and lies in wa'
 b'it for the faint vibrations created by a creature moving above it. While hid'
 b'den under the ice and snow, it can lower its body temperature so that it doe'
 b'sn\'t melt its cover.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><di'

 b'Frost giant hunters scour the icy wastes for remorhaz nests and eggs. The gi'
 b'ants prize young remorhazes, which can be trained from hatching to obey comm'
 b"ands and guard the giants' icy citadels. Unlike fully grown specimens, young"
 b' remorhazes gnaw on their victims instead of swallowing them whole.</p><div '
