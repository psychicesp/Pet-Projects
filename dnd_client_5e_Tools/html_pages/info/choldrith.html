 b'Unnatural Origin.</span></span> <p> Long ago, the drow first subjected elf p'
 b'risoners to horrible rituals that transformed the captives into creatures wi'
 b'th both humanoid and spider traits, which their creators dubbed chitines. Th'
 b"e dark elves' intention was to create slaves dedicated first of all to the d"
 b'row and, by association with them, to Lolth. As the drow ultimately discover'
 b'ed, the goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.</p><div class="rd__spc-'
 b'inline-post"></div><p>The creation process required cooperation between magi'
 b'cal disciplines. Drow wizards and warlocks used arcane magic and demonic pow'
 b"ers, and drow priestesses invoked Lolth's aid for the divine spark needed to"
 b" ensure the subject's survival. Lolth watched, expecting at some part of the"
 b' process to see these new abominations dedicated to her, but no such ritual '
 b'was performed. In retribution for this lack of respect, the Spider Queen twi'
 b"sted the drow's creation rituals to serve her own purposes.</p><p>At first, "
 b"the drow were unaware that the new creatures were signs of Lolth's displeasu"
 b're with them. Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs '
 b'that birthed more chitines (and the rare choldrith) and could direct the chi'
 b'tines in their work. But the dark elves came to realize their mistake-choldr'
 b'iths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. They whispered to the chitines of the'
 b'ir adoration of the Spider Queen and their enmity of the drow, and the seeds'
 b' of a rebellion took root and grew. The chitines and choldriths rose up agai'
 b'nst their would-be masters; soon afterward most of the creatures were free, '
 b'and a number of the drow who helped breed and tend them were dead.</p><p>Now'
 b'adays, drow still create chitines when they have need to. Outside the presen'
 b'ce of a choldrith, chitines make good workers for the drow, and they can be '
 b'useful if the drow find an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate'
 b' it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the drow destroy th'
 b'e creature immediately.</p><p>As servants of Lolth, choldriths and chitines '
 b'love spiders and spider-like creatures. They rear spiders and similar arachn'
 b'ids, such as cave fishers. Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serv'
 b'e as beacons, attracting spiders and other evil, brutish beings that serve h'
 b'er. Anywhere chitines set up a colony quickly becomes a web-shrouded, gloomy'
 b', and treacherous place.</p><p>A colony can support numerous choldriths, whi'
 b'ch serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually'
 b' jockey for position, although they rarely confront one another in a way tha'
 b't puts the colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a singular sovereign that '
 b'determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether she o'
 b'r any other choldrith is permitted to lay eggs. If this supreme ruler receiv'
 b"es a vision from Lolth, she might change her colony's entire course of actio"
 b'n. At such times, chitines have emerged from the Underdark to settle in remo'
 b'te, gloomy places on the surface, from where they can wage war on other spec'
 b'ies, especially drow and elves.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span c'

 b'o perform the rituals, the process usually transformed the subject into the '
 b'spindly, stunted creature they expected. Occasionally, though, the elf chang'
 b'ed into a monstrosity that was more spider than elf, resembling Lolth in her'
 b' spider form, and more cunning than a chitine, that the drow dubbed a choldr'
 b'ith.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b'

 b're born with a fanatical devotion to Lolth, which leads them to develop some'
 b" skill in divine magic. They preach that chitines are Lolth's favored people"
 b", and that choldriths are the Spider Queen's rightful worldly representative"
 b's sent to free the chitines from slavery. Although choldriths and chitines l'
 b'ack sexual characteristics, and choldriths need no mate to lay eggs, these c'
 b'reatures choose the gender identity of their goddess. Choldriths also believ'
 b"e and teach that Lolth's spider form, much like that of a choldrith, is her "
 b'truest shape. Any idol to Lolth in a chitine colony depicts Lolth in this wa'

 b'ldriths resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as a'
 b'nts. Chitines are divided into worker and warrior castes, and choldriths occ'
 b"upy the top levels of a colony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social positi"
 b'on that comes with duties related to that rank, and all chitines are expecte'
 b'd to willingly sacrifice themselves to protect the choldriths. Every chitine'
 b' has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, wa'
 b'lls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit and protect the colony. A w'
 b'arrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hid'
