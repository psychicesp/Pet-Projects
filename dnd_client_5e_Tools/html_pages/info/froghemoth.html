 b'<p> Every few years, a froghemoth can lay a fertile egg without mating. The '
 b'froghemoth cares nothing for its egg, and might eat the hatchling. A young f'
 b"roghemoth's survival is most often predicated on its parent leaving it behin"
 b'd in indifference. A newborn froghemoth grows to full size over a period of '
 b'months by indiscriminately preying on other creatures in its swampy domain. '
 b'It learns to hide its enormous body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestal'
 b'k above water to watch for passing creatures. When food comes within reach, '
 b'the froghemoth erupts from its pool, tentacles and tongue flailing. It can g'
 b'rab several targets at once, keeping them at bay while it wraps its tongue a'
 b'round another one and pulls it in to be devoured.</p><div class="rd__spc-inl'
