 b'esh and blood even after death, it can rise as a vampire to continue its fee'
 b'ding frenzy.</p><p>A gnoll vampire is a savage predator that feeds on the bl'
 b'ood of the living. It cackles maniacally when it catches the scent of its pr'
 b'ey and quickly moves in for the kill, tearing away flesh with its claws, gor'
 b'ging on meat and blood, and leaving nothing behind but bones, gristle, and t'
 b"he victim's blood-spattered belongings.</p><p>Gnoll vampires are indiscrimin"
 b'ate feeders that prefer the flesh and blood of humanoids, including other gn'
 b"olls. Their noses can't stand the scent of perfumes, and their ears can't ab"
 b"ide words spoken aloud in Celestial. They don't cast reflections in mirrors "
 b"unless they want to.</p><p>Unlike normal vampires, gnoll vampires don't have"
 b' coffins where they rest, and they have no such places to return to when the'
 b'ir corporeal bodies are destroyed. They are undeterred by running water, and'
 b' they can enter residences without invitation. When a gnoll vampire needs to'
 b' travel quickly, it adopts the form of a giant, emaciated hyena. When it wan'
 b'ts to catch its prey by surprise, it takes the form of a cloud of mist. Afte'
 b"r it feeds on a victim's blood, its mist form takes on a crimson hue for an "
 b'hour or so before its colorlessness returns.</p><div class="rd__b-inset"><sp'
