Cunning negotiators, these strange fiends handle the writing of contracts for all of their kind. Once a yagnoloth is hired, it communicates its employer\'s desires to the fiends it commands.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Although they are entrusted with leading lesser yugoloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their orders from arcanaloths and ultroloths. Aside from their superiors, yagnoloths have full authority over and expect obedience from the fiends under their command. A yagnoloth follows the dictates in a contract it negotiated, but it is certain to have included a loophole to escape its obligation if the situation warrants.</p><p>A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and one giant-sized arm, and it always covers one or the other with a long cape. During negotiations, the yagnoloth uncovers its human arm and uses it to draft and sign contracts. When a show of force is necessary or when combat is joined, it shifts its cape to reveal its brutally powerful giant appendage.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8805"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Yugoloths.</span></span> <p>Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for ever more wealth. Although yugoloths aren't especially loyal and typically try to exploit every potential loophole in a contract, they undertake any task for which they are hired, no matter how despicable. Yugoloths come in a wide variety of forms, including those described in the <a href="bestiary.html#blankhash,flstsource:mm=1,flsttag:yugoloth=1">Monster Manual</a> and the six creatures presented <a href="bestiary.html#blankhash,flstsource:mtf=1,flsttag:yugoloth=1">here</a>.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
