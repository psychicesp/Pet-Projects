 b'n, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animate'
 b'd skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skelet'
 b'on restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empow'
 b'ers it.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>While most skeletons ar'

 b'ised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to '
 b'the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless '
 b'of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and'
 b' unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. The'
 b"y can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake t"
 b'heir heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of r'
 b'elatively complex tasks.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A skel'
 b'eton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or '
 b'trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. Ho'
 b'wever, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are ac'
 b'complished.</p><p>Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, s'
 b"keletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter i"
 b'ts way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that does'
 b"n't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.</p></d"
