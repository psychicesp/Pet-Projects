This form of lycanthropy can't be removed while the loup garou that inflicted the curse lives. See the <i>Monster Manual</i> for details on lycanthropy.</p><p>Once a loup garou is slain, a remove curse spell cast during the night of a full moon on any afflicted werewolf it created forces the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the curse is broken, and the target returns to its normal form and gains 3 levels of exhaustion. On a failure, the curse remains, and the target automatically fails any saving throw made to break this curse for 1 month.</p></div></div></td>')
