 b'Divine servants that inhabit unspoiled corners of the world, nymphs protect '
 b'places of natural power and infuse their surroundings with the magic of Nyx.'
 b' Some are benevolent and aid those who live off the land, while others embod'
 b'y violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sa'
 b'pient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interpla'
 b'y of wild animals, or other cosmic forces. Occasionally, though, groups of t'
 b'he same kind of nymphs congregate in a place of natural power or beauty. In '
 b'times of special need, deities tied to facets of nature might employ nymphs '
 b'as messengers, guardians, or scouts.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span cl'
