Writhing cilia cover their bodies, with longer tendrils around their heads and two wiry tentacles protruding from their bare shoulders. A dolgaunt is blind but can perceive its surroundings through the sensitive cilia that cover its skin. It can also absorb life through its tentacles, allowing it to drain the vitality out of any creature it touches.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1308"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Warped by Chaos.</span></span> <p>When the daelkyr emerged from Xoriat to conquer Khorvaire, they captured and transformed that land's indigenous creatures to create armies of hideous warriors.
