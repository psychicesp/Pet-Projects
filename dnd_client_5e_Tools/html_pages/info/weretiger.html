 b'y can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its na'
 b'tural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal '
 b'self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of t'
 b'heir animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful ve'
 b'rsion of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark o'
 b'f unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.</p><p>Evil lycanthr'
 b'opes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terr'
 b'or and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclus'
 b'ive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone i'
 b'n wilderness areas far from villages and towns.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--'

 b'<p>A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the'
 b' curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in '
 b'humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial '
 b'urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes'
 b' too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or in'
 b'to a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the'
 b' moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if th'
 b'e cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the eve'
 b'nts of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope a'
 b's bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the cur'
 b'se and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master '
 b'their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will'
 b'. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust,'
 b' becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.</p></div></di'
