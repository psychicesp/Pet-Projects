 b"eler for a winter coat, chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood, and so o"
 b'n. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, su'
 b'ch as a greedy merchant hoarding more food for the winter than he could poss'
 b'ibly eat while others starve. Bheurs love to seed such ideas and thoughts in'
 b' mortals. They use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages wi'
 b'th snow and freezing cold, hoping to instill despair that turns the villager'
 b's against each other.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A bheur h'
