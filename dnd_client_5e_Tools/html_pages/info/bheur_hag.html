They become more active during winter, using their ice and weather magic to make life miserable for nearby settlements.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A bheur hag\'s skin is blue-white, like that of a person who has frozen to death. Her hair is pale white, and she is emaciated, as if she were a person who had survived winter by eating bark and leather. Her eyes are pale and surrounded by dark, bruise-colored flesh. A bheur carries a twisted gray wooden staff, which she can ride like a flying broom and augments her magical powers.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="229"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Cold Hearts.</span></span> <p> Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions justified by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat, chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood, and so on. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding more food for the winter than he could possibly eat while others starve. Bheurs love to seed such ideas and thoughts in mortals. They use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with snow and freezing cold, hoping to instill despair that turns the villagers against each other.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A bheur hag loves watching unprepared people suffer and die for their mistakes during the winter.

The sight of this savagery is enough to render witnesses temporarily insane.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="231"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Covens.</span></span> <p> A bheur hag that is part of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a challenge rating of 9 (5,000 XP).</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="232"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lair Actions</span></span> <p>The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all).

Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC <span class="rd__dc">20</span> Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.</li></ul><p>A powerful bheur hag might have the following additional lair action:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li">The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its possession.</li></ul></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="233"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Regional Effects</span></span> <p>Each hag\'s lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders.
