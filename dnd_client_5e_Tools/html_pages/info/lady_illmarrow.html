 b' tales claim that when anyone dies in Lhazaar, Illmarrow chooses whether to '
 b'take their soul before it passes on to the Keeper and Dolurrh.</p><p>But Lad'
 b'y Illmarrow is no folk tale. She is the greatest necromancer in Eberron, and'
 b' after centuries of silence, she is setting ancient plots into motion at las'

 b'r founding the order are buried in her past. Lady Illmarrow has no interest '

 b' rites with a clan of dragons. The discovery of this pact triggered an unpre'
 b'cedented alliance between the Sibling Kings of Aerenal and the dragons of Ar'
 b'gonnessen. The Sibling Kings proclaimed that House Vol would be exterminated'
 b' to the last member, and the Mark of Death would be eliminated from the worl'
 b'd.</p><p>The line of Vol had long been rivals of the Undying Court, and many'
 b' whisper even today that the attack on House Vol was nothing more than an ex'
 b'cuse to eliminate a political rival. But others believe that what the Undyin'
 b'g Court truly feared was a path shown in the Draconic Prophecy\xe2\x80'
 b'\x94that a child born of dragon and elf could become a godlike avatar of de'

 b' gateway to immortality and unrivaled power, but she was hunted down and kil'
 b"led long before she could master the mark's magic. Her mother, Minara Vol, e"
 b"scaped with her daughter's body to the icy reaches of Farlnen, far from the "

 b'To the world, the last survivor of that bloodline is known as Lady Illmarrow'
