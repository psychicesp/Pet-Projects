 b"mbines the features of a cat and a lizard, one arm that ends in a crab's pin"
 b'cer, and one leg that ends in a cloven hoof. Another might have the skin and'

 b'they can hide. They use such camouflage while hunting in the wild or while s'
 b'tanding guard outside their lairs. Until it is seen, a camouflaged mongrelfo'
