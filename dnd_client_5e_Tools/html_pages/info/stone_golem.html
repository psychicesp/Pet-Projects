 b'nstruction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great '

 b"e spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's c"
 b'reator.</p><p>A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item tha'
 b't allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creato'
 b'rs are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.</p><p>A golem '
