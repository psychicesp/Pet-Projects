Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists or taking charge of worshipers to carry out a sensitive mission. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyal to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="114"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Outsiders in Hell.</span></span> <p>Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when the dark lord chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat's orders or Asmodeus's.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus's plans invites certain destruction.</p></div><p class="rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last">\xe2\x80\x9c<i>Tiamat is a force of Chaos bound to a place of Law.
