 b'ar their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspec'
 b't those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might sli'
 b'p aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treas'
 b'ure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the'
 b' ship\'s captain for the item.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div>'

 b'illain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good an'
