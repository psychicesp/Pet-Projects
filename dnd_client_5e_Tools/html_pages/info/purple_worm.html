 b'nges forward by rhythmically compressing and expanding its body, catching ot'

 b'span> <p>When a purple worm burrows through the ground, it consumes earth an'
 b'd rock, which it breaks down and constantly excretes. Precious metals and ge'
 b'ms can thus be found within the bodies of purple worms, which are targeted b'
 b'y particularly brave and foolhardy treasure hunters.</p><div class="rd__spc-'

 b' throughout the Underdark, which are quickly made use of by other creatures '
 b'as corridors and highways. Because a purple worm rarely returns to its own t'
 b'unnels, such passageways are a good place to avoid these monsters. Areas ric'
 b'h in prey quickly become interlaced with complex tunnel systems resulting fr'
 b'om several worms hunting together.</p></div></div></div></td>')
