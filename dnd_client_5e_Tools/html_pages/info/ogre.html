 b't the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre'
 b"'s wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or proddin"
 b'g it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When it'
 b's rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs '
 b'out of objects or creatures to smash.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></'

 b' taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner '
 b'with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If e'
 b'nough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make '
 b"a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. T"
 b'his macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.</p><div class="rd__spc-i'

 b'include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough p'
 b'atch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig.'
 b' Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one'
 b" another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's "
 b'trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p>'
