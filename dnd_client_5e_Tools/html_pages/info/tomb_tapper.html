 b'canists who created these creatures called them "thaluud," which means "face'
 b'less." Wrought from the fusion of magic and elemental earth, each of these s'
 b'exless, hairless warriors stands 15 to 21 feet tall and possesses a lust for'
 b' magic, an inherited memory (composed of recollections from the souls sacrif'
 b'iced in their creation), and an insane hatred for nonhuman spellcasting crea'
 b'tures. Tomb tappers can dig through earth and rock with their claws or use t'
 b'heir metal sledgehammers to shatter rock when needed. They absorb water thro'

 b'available.</p><p>The Netherese sent the thaluud into the Underdark to exterm'
 b'inate their enemies, most notably the magic-devouring, funnel-shaped creatur'
 b'es known as phaerimm. Other creatures targeted by the thaluud include mind f'
