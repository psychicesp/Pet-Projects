<td class="text" colspan="6"><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><p>The Netherese arcanists who created these creatures called them "thaluud," which means "faceless." Wrought from the fusion of magic and elemental earth, each of these sexless, hairless warriors stands 15 to 21 feet tall and possesses a lust for magic, an inherited memory (composed of recollections from the souls sacrificed in their creation), and an insane hatred for nonhuman spellcasting creatures. Tomb tappers can dig through earth and rock with their claws or use their metal sledgehammers to shatter rock when needed. They absorb water through their skin and crush rock with their jaws to extract mineral sustenance. They can also digest iron from blood and marrow, if mineral-rich rock is unavailable.</p><p>The Netherese sent the thaluud into the Underdark to exterminate their enemies, most notably the magic-devouring, funnel-shaped creatures known as phaerimm. Other creatures targeted by the thaluud include mind flayers, derro, drow, and duergar. Tomb tappers communicate with one another by means of a humming sound created by skin vibrations.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7798"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Seekers of Magic.</span></span> <p>Tomb tappers received their colloquial name from their habit of burrowing into the depths to plunder tombs, temples, and caves in search of magic items, which they bear off. They usually try to seize magic from beings that they encounter.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Magic is sacred to tomb tappers. They don't use any magic items they acquire, instead choosing to protect and venerate such items. Tappers spend their long lives in the search for the source of all magic, which they believe to be hidden deep in the Underdark. They are in awe of earth elementals, believing that they come directly from this source, and are reluctant to attack them.</p></div></div></div></td>')
