 b'When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the p'
 b'hysical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the po'
 b'wer to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devil'
 b's to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archd'
 b'evil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation'

 b'v class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Low-level promotions are typically ba'
 b'sed on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain i'
 b'nvisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always ba'
 b'sed on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle '
 b'is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is se'
 b'ldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal form'
 b's.</p><p>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience am'
 b'ong the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a '
 b'lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demo'
 b'te a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its'
 b' memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excess'
 b'ive.</p><p>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn f'
 b"ealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's most pow"
 b'erful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely dem'
 b'ote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.'
