 b"pose of gold-forged sentinels is a mystery, and of all Purphoros's original "
 b'anvilwroughts, this construct is the most difficult to control. A sentinel o'

 b' to carry out their mysterious purpose.</p><p>The first anvilwroughts were c'
 b'reated by the god of the forge, Purphoros. He gave the secret of breathing l'
 b'ife into these metal creatures to his most devoted followers so they could m'
 b'imic his works and invent new forms at their own forges.</p><p>Some anvilwro'
 b'ughts are vigilant guardians at holy shrines, others serve as familiars and '
 b'messengers, and a few were created to emulate beauty found among the animals'
 b' of the mortal world. Each exhibits abilities suited to its role, with some '
 b'behaving like companionable creatures or stoic guardians.</p><p>A few extrem'
 b'ely rare and valuable anvilwroughts were crafted by the hand of Purphoros hi'
 b'mself. A number of these magnificent creations are now heirlooms of monarchs'
 b'; others are lost to the sands of time or are guarded by ancient monsters.</'
