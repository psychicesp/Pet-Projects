 b'f greed and strife perished in the battles among the immortals. Its body dri'
 b'fted through the Astral Plane, eventually becoming a petrified husk. This co'
 b'rpse floated up against a pearlescent remnant of celestial matter imbued wit'
 b'h life and life-giving magic. The collision shattered both objects and relea'
 b'sed a storm of chaotic energy. Countless islands of mixed matter spun away i'
 b'nto the silvery void. Within some of them, a vein of pearl-like material hel'
 b"d a bit of the deity's rejuvenated supernatural vitality, which spontaneousl"
 b"y created a habitable environment. On those same islands, bits of the god's "
 b'petrified flesh came back to life, in the form of tentacled monstrosities br'
 b'imming with malice and greed. Ever since that time, each morkoth has had an '
 b'extraplanar island to call home.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><'
 b'p>The pearly matter inside an island enables it to glide on planar currents,'
 b" maintains the island's environment, and keeps the place safe from harmful e"
 b"xternal effects. A morkoth's island might be found anywhere from the bottom "
 b'of the ocean to the void of the Astral Plane. One could float in the skies o'
 b'f Avernus in the Nine Hells without being destroyed and without causing harm'
 b" to its residents. Whatever is on or within a certain distance of a morkoth'"
 b's isle travels with it in its journey through the planes. Thus, people from '
 b'lost civilizations and creatures or objects from bygone ages might be found '
 b"within a morkoth's dominion.</p><p>Some islands travel a specific route, arr"
 b'iving at the same destinations regularly over a cycle of years. Others are t'
 b'ied to a particular place or group of locales, and still others move erratic'
 b"ally through the cosmos. Rarely, a morkoth learns to control its island's mo"
 b'vement, so the island goes wherever its master wishes.</p><p>A morkoth spend'
 b's its time watching over its collection and plotting to acquire more possess'
 b'ions. The monster hoards vast stores of treasure and knowledge. Its island h'
 b'olds numerous captives, which it considers part of its collection. Some inha'
 b'bitants, such as descendants of original prisoners, might view the morkoth a'
 b"s a ruler or a god. A morkoth's storehouse of wealth and lore attracts would"
 b'-be plunderers, of course, as well as those seeking something specific the m'
 b'orkoth has or knows. The creature shows no mercy to those that try to steal '
 b'from it, but it can be bargained with by a visitor that offers the morkoth s'
 b'omething it desires.</p><p>No morkoth freely gives away what it owns. Morkot'
 b'hs exist to acquire, and they give up possessions only if doing so helps the'
 b'ir hoard grow.</p><p>A morkoth knows every object in its collection and can '
 b'track its possessions through the planes. Someone who dares to steal from a '
 b'morkoth, or breaks a deal with one, will know no rest until the morkoth is s'
 b'lain or all promises are kept.</p><p>Collectors of everything odd, unusual, '
