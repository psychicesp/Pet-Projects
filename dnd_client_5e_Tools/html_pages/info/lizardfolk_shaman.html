 b'uflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visito'

 b'sers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and ot'

 b'folk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of g'
 b'ood and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is ex'
 b'pedient and do whatever it takes to survive.</p><p>Lizardfolk rarely stray b'
 b'eyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territor'
 b'y is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction'
 b" between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don't like r"
 b'eaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hun'
 b'ted instead of the hunters.</p><p>Occasions might arise when lizardfolk will'
 b' form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firstha'
 b'nd that humans, dwarves, halflings, and elves can sometimes prove helpful or'
 b' trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast '
 b'and fierce allies.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h r'
