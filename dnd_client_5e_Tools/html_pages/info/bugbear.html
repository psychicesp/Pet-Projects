 b'er, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for s'
 b'erving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unre'
 b'liable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much'

 b'are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and tre'

 b'd member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band'

 b'ompanions if doing so saves its life.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></'
