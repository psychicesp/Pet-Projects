 b'A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its form'

 b'e implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vuln'
 b'erable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.</p></div><div class="rd__b'

 b'es create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms that have roa'
 b'ring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects mig'
 b'ht move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghos'
 b't has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.</p><div class'
