Its ten long tentacles are made of hundreds of ring-shaped muscles sheathed in tough fibrous hide. Sharp barbs line the tip each tentacle and inject paralytic venom. The grell can partially retract its barbs into its tentacles to handle or manipulate objects it doesn't want to pierce or tear.</p><p>Grells have no eyes and floats by means of a sort of levitation. They have keen hearing, however, and their skin is sensitive to vibrations and electrical fields, allowing them to detect the presence of creatures and objects in their immediate vicinity. The creature's ability to manipulate electricity to sense and move also allow it to absorb lightning without harm.</p><p>Although solitary by nature, grells sometimes gather in small groups called covens.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3243"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Floating Ambushers.</span></span> <p>A grell prefers to ambush lone creatures or stragglers, hovering silently near the ceiling of a passage or cavern until a suitable target passes below, whereupon it descends quickly and wraps its tentacles around its prey.

Grells have no compunction about attacking creatures they classify as edible, including humanoids.
