 b"an> <p>An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can "
 b'sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simpl'
 b'e deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether'
 b' intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the '
 b'angel as an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connect'
 b'ion to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their '
 b'banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking r'
 b'ulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hi'
 b'erarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine '
 b'Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign them'
 b'selves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as'
 b' simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedic'
 b'ated to justice and compassionate service.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-pos'
