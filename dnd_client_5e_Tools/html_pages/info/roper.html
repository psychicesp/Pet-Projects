 b'unting tactics. A roper can hold still for long hours, shutting its single e'
 b'ye to look like nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. Creatures tha'
 b't come too close are surprised when that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils '
 b'shoot out to seize them. The roper then makes horrible guttural sounds as it'
