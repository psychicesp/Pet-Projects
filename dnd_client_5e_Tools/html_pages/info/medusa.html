(b'<td class="text" colspan="6"><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><p>Medusas (often c'
 b'alled gorgons on Theros) are closely associated with Pharika, the god of poi'
 b'son and medicine. Pharika has charged her favored servants with guarding sec'
 b'rets of life, health, and immortality that are too powerful to be known by t'
 b'hose who lack the wisdom to use them properly. Those who approach a medusa w'
 b"ith humility and worthy offerings might receive the creature's favor. The me"
 b'dusa might propose a dangerous quest to fetch some rare ingredient or legend'
 b"ary relic, promising to reward success with a bit of Pharika's knowledge. Th"
 b'is information might lead to a cure for a plague, an alchemical breakthrough'
 b', or a secret of the cosmos.</p></div></td>')
