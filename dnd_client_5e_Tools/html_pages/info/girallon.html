 b"r warm forest environments abundant with life. They share the ape's adeptnes"
 b's at climbing, although these half-ton creatures shy away from scaling trees'
 b" that can't support their bulk. Instead, they stalk the forest floor, lurk i"
 b'n narrow ravines or shallow caves, or hide in ruined sites while waiting for'
 b' prey to come near. A girallon is surprisingly stealthy, considering its siz'
 b'e and its lack of camouflage.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>G'
 b'irallons form loose bands of several individuals and their offspring, usuall'
 b'y led by a dominant adult that also tends to be the oldest member of the gro'
 b'up. When on the hunt away from their lair, girallons use roars and body lang'
 b'uage to communicate with one another over distance. Each individual typicall'
 b'y hunts alone and widely separated from the others, to ensure that everyone '
 b'gets adequate fodder. The leader might organize members to work together to '
 b'make a big kill. If they succeed, everyone in the group shares the spoils, w'
 b'ith the best parts going to mothers caring for their young.</p><p>In the tim'
 b'e since then, numerous creatures have tried to tame, subjugate, or cooperate'
 b' with the monsters. For instance, yuan-ti enslave girallons, turning them in'
 b'to border sentinels for their serpent kingdoms. Because girallons are known '
 b'to be peaceful among their own kind, some humanoids have learned how to appr'
 b"oach a group's leader, offering food and other gifts in hopes of establishin"
 b'g an alliance with the creatures.</p><p>Girallons that are well treated migh'
 b't be willing to serve as guards, though they lack the intelligence to take o'
 b'n tasks more complicated than attacking strangers that enter their domain. I'
 b'f one is taken young and properly trained, a girallon could end up in a seem'
 b"ingly unlikely place, such as guarding the entrance to a city's thieves' gui"
 b'ld. Those who would keep a girallon as a pet must always be wary, because th'
 b'e creature could revert to its predatory nature at any time.</p></div><div c'

 b' The ruins of humanoid habitations, especially those found in deep forests a'
 b'nd jungles, seem to attract girallons. They move effortlessly along stairs a'
 b'nd balconies, as well as on the sloped rooftops and buttresses of such forma'
 b"tions. To a girallon, a city's buildings are just another sort of forest-and"
 b' better yet, one whose uppermost "branches" can easily support the creatures'
 b'. In such a setting, the girallons take full advantage of their skill in cli'
 b'mbing. The creatures can easily scale walls and battlements, and they perch '
