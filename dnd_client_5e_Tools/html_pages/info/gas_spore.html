As they mature, fungi eject spores that drift on the lightest breeze to spawn new fungi.</p><p>Not needing sunlight or warmth to grow, fungi thrive in every corner and crevice of the Underdark. Transformed by the magic that permeates that underground realm, Underdark fungi often develop potent defensive mechanisms or abilities of mimicry and attack.

Piercing the shell with even the weakest attack causes the creature to burst apart, releasing a cloud of deadly spores. A creature that inhales the spores becomes host to them, and is often dead within a day. Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2523"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Beholder Memories.</span></span> <p>A gas spore that sprouts from a beholder's corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent.
