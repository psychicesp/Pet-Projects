 b' to remain hidden in the shadows, watching with rapt attention as its very p'
 b'resence affects its victims. Its dark energy weighs down the heart, causing '
 b'those within its oppressive aura to feel the approach of death. This torment'
 b' alone is enough to please its master, the Raven Queen, but should it be det'
 b'ected, a gloom weaver uses its shadow magic to reduce its enemies to ghastly'
