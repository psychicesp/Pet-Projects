 b'n by a hunger for power and security, it advances against humanoid settlemen'
 b'ts, using its eye rays to destroy every creature it encounters, then buildin'
 b'g an army of undead. If left unchecked, a death tyrant might wipe out the po'
 b'pulation of a city in weeks, then set its undead eye on wider conquest. As e'
