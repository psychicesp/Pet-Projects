When such dreams take hold, a beholder can transform, its flesh sloughing away to leave a death tyrant behind. This monster possesses the cunning and much of the magic it had in life, but it is fueled by the power of undeath. A death tyrant appears as a massive, naked skull, with a pinpoint of red light gleaming in its hollow eye socket. With its eyestalks rotted away, ten spectral eyes hover above the creature and glare in all directions.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1069"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Deathly Despot.</span></span> <p>As they did when they were beholders, death tyrants lord their power over other creatures. Moreover, a beholder's ability to quash magical energy with its central eye gives way to a more sinister power in a death tyrant, which can transform former slaves and enemies into undead servants.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Zombies created by a death tyrant are used and discarded as needed.

Driven by a hunger for power and security, it advances against humanoid settlements, using its eye rays to destroy every creature it encounters, then building an army of undead. If left unchecked, a death tyrant might wipe out the population of a city in weeks, then set its undead eye on wider conquest. As each settlement falls, the death tyrant's zombie forces build to overwhelming numbers.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1071"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>A death tyrant doesn\'t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1072"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">A Death Tyrant's Lair.</span></span> <p>A death tyrant's lair is usually the same site it held as a beholder, but it contains more trappings of death and decay.
