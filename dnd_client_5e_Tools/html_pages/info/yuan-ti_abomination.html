 b'of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the ser'
 b"pent's sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. The"
 b'ir advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of c'
 b'lear, focused thought.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Yuan-ti '
 b'culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legen'
 b'dary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers o'
 b'f ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they long'
 b'ed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant'
 b' voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must'
 b' do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound t'
 b'hemselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulg'
 b'ing in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti'
 b' bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the ser'
 b'pent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.</p><p>Yuan-ti know tha'
 b"t the world they hope to rule can't be bound for long by brute force, and th"
 b'at many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence'
 b' other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, human'
 b'oid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget tha'
 b't a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so on'
 b'ly as part of a grander design.</p><p>Yuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthle'
 b'ss tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory just'
 b'ifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first i'
 b'n decisive ambush if they can.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span cl'
