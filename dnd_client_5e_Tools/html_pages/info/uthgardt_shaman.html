 b'f magic. Seldom do they choose to become shamans. Instead, the role is thrus'
 b't upon those who are born with a strong connection to the spirit world. To b'
 b'e a shaman is to stand apart from the tribe, with one foot in the land of th'
 b'e living and the other in the land of the dead. Those who walk the shadowed '
 b'path between two lands do so because the spirits of the dead compel them. Ot'
 b"her Uthgardt fear and respect a shaman's power.</p><p>An Uthgardt shaman mus"
 b't possess a sacred bundle to cast spells. A sacred bundle is made up of stic'
 b'ks, bones, feathers, tufts of fur, and stones that have been "touched" by sp'
 b'irits. It takes a month for a shaman to assemble a sacred bundle, and a sham'
 b'an can use only one such bundle at a time. A sacred bundle benefits only the'
 b" shaman who created it, and it doesn't replace the normal components of a sp"
 b'ell.</p><p>In addition to the spells that all Uthgardt shamans can cast, a s'
 b'haman of a particular tribe gains additional spells based on tribal affiliat'
 b'ion (see the "Uthgardt Sha man Tribal Spells" sidebar).</p><p>By communing w'
 b"ith their ancestors' spirits, Uthgardt shamans can also learn secret rituals"
 b'. These rituals almost always require some sort of blood sacrifice, and thei'
 b'r effects are usually transformative. For example, some Black Raven shamans '
 b'know a ritual that allows them to hatch giant ravens from normal raven eggs,'
 b' and some shamans of the Griffon tribe can transform them selves into griffo'
 b'ns by performing a ritual that requires them to drink copious amounts of hor'
 b'se blood.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-t'
