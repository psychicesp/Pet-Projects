 b'er follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete wit'
 b'h other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories whe'
 b're death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves,'
 b' sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion'
 b' crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A carrion crawler r'
 b'oams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or de'
 b'cay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they'
 b' move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and '
 b'other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential'
 b' meals that don\'t think to look up.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post">'

 b'ght, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light '
 b'source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent of blood. Desp'
 b'ite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by wa'
 b'iting around blind corners for prey to come to them. When facing potential p'
 b'rey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a vict'
 b'im goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacle'
 b's and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be '
 b'killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiti'
 b'ng for its meal to ripen.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></'
