 b'at control undead. These foul monsters are entirely bound to the will of the'
 b'ir creator, which can concentrate on a claw in sight to mentally command its'
 b" every action. If the crawling claw's creator doesn't command it, the claw f"
 b'ollows its last command to the best of its ability.</p><div class="rd__spc-i'

 b"w can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its "
 b'limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out spe'
 b'cific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular '
 b'locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and d'
 b'oorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree.</p></div><div'

 b'an> <p>A crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the'
 b' individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed'
 b' that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw'
 b"'s torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imit"
 b'ates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.</p><div cla'
