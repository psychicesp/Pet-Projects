 b'at are skilled in arcana and associated with dragons. The cooperation of a d'

 b'agon allied with the group), a large amount of fresh meat, and an iron cauld'
 b'ron. When the process is complete, a halfling-sized egg emerges from the cau'
 b'ldron and is ready to hatch within a few hours.</p><p>A guard drake resemble'
