When trained properly, a drake is obedient, loyal, and territorial, which makes it an excellent watch-beast that can follow simple commands.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="130"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Gifts from Dragons.</span></span> <p> The ritual to create a guard drake was originally devised by the cult of Tiamat, but has spread to other groups that are skilled in arcana and associated with dragons. The cooperation of a dragon is necessary for the ritual to succeed, and a dragon typically provides its help when it wants to reward its allies or worshipers with a valuable servant.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The ritual, which takes several days, requires 10 pounds of fresh dragon scales (donated by the dragon allied with the group), a large amount of fresh meat, and an iron cauldron. When the process is complete, a halfling-sized egg emerges from the cauldron and is ready to hatch within a few hours.</p><p>A guard drake resembles the type of dragon it was created from, but with a wingless, squat, muscular build. A drake can't reproduce, nor can its scales be used to make other guard drakes.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="131"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Eager to Learn.</span></span> <p> A newly hatched guard drake imprints upon the first creature that feeds it (usually the one planning to train it), establishing an aggressive but trusting bond with that individual. A guard drake is fully grown within two to three weeks and can be trained in the same length of time. One is the equivalent of a guard dog in terms of what it can be trained to do.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="132"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Variant: Chromatic Guard Drakes.</span></span> <p>Each type of chromatic dragon's scales and blood creates a guard drake that resembles a wingless, stunted version of that type of dragon, with unique abilities related to that type.
