 b're appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standi'
 b'ng thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swingin'

 b'owstopper.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Sometimes after his '
 b'grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who ado'
 b're him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a deman'
 b'ding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no p'
 b"atience for performers who don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brou"
 b'ght more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close. Jaded as he '
 b"is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats in"
 b"to his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but hi"
 b's followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spec'
 b'tacle.</p></div></div></div></td>')
