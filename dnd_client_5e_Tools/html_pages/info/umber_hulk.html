Those lucky enough to survive an umber hulk attack often remember precious little of the incident, thanks to the umber hulk's mind-scrambling gaze.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8005"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Devious Delvers.</span></span> <p>Umber hulks can burrow through solid rock, forming new tunnels in their wake.

When it explodes out in a shower of earth and rock, its unsuspecting quarry turns to face the oncoming threat-and is entranced by the umber hulk's bewildering eyes, forced to stand helpless as its mandibles snap shut.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8006"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Mind Scrambler.</span></span> <p>Many survivors of an umber hulk encounter recollect little about the attack, because the monster's confusing gaze scrambles their memory of the event. Those who have fought and killed umber hulks recognize the signs. For other denizens of the Underdark, grisly tales of vanished explorers and wanton destruction speak of an unknown foe. Umber hulks take on supernatural status in these harrowing stories, many of which convey the same warning: once an umber hulk has been spotted, it is already too late to escape it.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
