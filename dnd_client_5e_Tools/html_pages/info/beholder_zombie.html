 b'Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. How'
 b'ever, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run it'
 b's course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloat'
 b'ed after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way '
 b'from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore '
 b'or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.</p><div '
