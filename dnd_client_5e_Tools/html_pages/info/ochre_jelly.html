 b'span> <p>Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extrem'
 b'e temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creat'
 b'ure or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping fro'
 b'm walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and s'
 b'queezing through cracks.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The fi'
 b"rst warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searin"
 b'g pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic '
 b'material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus,'
 b' and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is '
 b'a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><spa'

 b'y. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creat'
 b'ures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a vi'
 b"ctim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.</p><div class="

 b' its killers.</p><p>Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of'
 b' the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of inte'
 b'lligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservat'
 b'ion. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. '
 b'Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevol'
 b'ent intent.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3'

 b"ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to f"
 b'eed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever mon'
 b'sters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, a'
 b'n ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enoug'
 b'h to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and f'
 b'laming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a partic'
 b'ular tunnel or room.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div cl'
