 b'rom a central trunk, so while they possess independent minds, they share a s'
 b'ingle name-Trostani and a single life force. Usually Trostani communicates t'
 b'he will of the Worldsoul with one voice, but she retains three distinct pers'
 b'onalities that embody the three parts of the Selesnyan ideal: order, life, a'
 b'nd harmony. In the midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three person'
 b'alities have recently been at odds over how best to navigate the conclave th'
 b'rough such difficult times.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Tro'
