 b'pan> <p>Exiled from the Nine Hells, Moloch would do anything to reclaim his '
 b'position. Long ago, Moloch earned his place among the other archdevils throu'
 b'gh the glory he won driving demons out of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus rewarded '
 b'him by elevating Moloch to the rulership of Malbolge.</p><div class="rd__spc'
 b'-inline-post"></div><p>For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying against the '
 b'other archdevils as he sought still greater power. This animosity worked in '
 b"Asmodeus's favor, since Asmodeus knew that Moloch's scheming helped keep the"
 b' other archdevils in check. The arrangement began to unravel, however, when '
 b'Moloch took the night hag named Malagard for his advisor. Her words were poi'
 b'son, and gradually she convinced Moloch to direct his efforts to topple Asmo'
 b'deus.</p><p>Although the conspiracy nearly succeeded, it was thwarted. Moloc'
 b'h was stripped of his station and sentenced to death\xe2\x80\x94and only '
 b'the timely use of a planar portal allowed him to escape.</p><p>Moloch wasted'
 b' no time in preparing for his return. He amassed an army of devils and monst'
 b'ers and left them to make final preparations for invading the Nine Hells, wh'
 b'ile he ventured to a distant Material Plane in the hope of finding an artifa'
 b'ct that would ensure his success. While there, he became trapped, leaving hi'
 b's armies at the mercy of his enemies. In short order they were destroyed.</p'
 b'><p>Now, Moloch has been rendered nearly powerless after his last failure. H'
 b'e endlessly schemes of ways to return to his former status, but every time h'
 b"e enters the Nine Hells, he is demoted to an imp and can't regain his normal"
 b' powers until he leaves. Thus, he lives a split existence, sometimes schemin'
 b'g in Malbolge or other layers of the Hells and at other times wandering the '
 b'planes searching for magical might or secrets that might help him win back h'
 b'is title.</p><p>Rumors suggest that he can often be found in Sigil, where he'
 b' bargains with yugoloths to build yet another army with which he might invad'
 b'e Malbolge and wrest the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is, he has little '
 b'to offer in exchange, so he might bargain with mortals to gain their aid in '
 b'acquiring coin, jewels, and other riches in return for knowledge about the N'
 b"ine Hells and the other planes.</p><p>Most of Moloch's cultists have switche"
 b'd allegiance to one of the other archdevils, but idols constructed to honor '
 b'him still stand in deep dungeons, their jeweled eyes and the remnants of pow'
 b'er they hold drawing monstrous worshipers and unwise adventurers into places'
 b' where his foul influence remains.</p></div></div></div></td>')
