 b'p> An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and'
 b' gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of th'
 b"is torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before"
 b' it is too late.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Since not ever'
 b'y ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, '
 b'and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can b'
 b'e a rich source of treasure for its killers.</p><p>Whether this is true or n'
 b'ot, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and im'
 b'bue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sen'
 b'se of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacki'
 b'ng and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit gl'
 b'immers of sentience and malevolent intent.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b-'

 b'ze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that u'

 b's captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty '

 b'an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.</p><div class="rd__spc-inl'
