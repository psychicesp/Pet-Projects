Demogorgon's lair is a place of madness and duality; the portion of the palace that lies above water takes the form of two serpentine towers, each crowned by a skull-shaped minaret. There, Demogorgon's heads contemplate the mysteries of the arcane while arguing about how best to obliterate their rivals. The bulk of this palace extends deep underwater, in chill and darkened caverns.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1193"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lair Actions</span></span> <p>On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Demogorgon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: Demogorgon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li">Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round.
