 b'ge shields like plow blades. These shields bear spikes on their exterior and'
 b' have hollow interiors into which the dreadnought pours hot coals at the fir'
 b'st sign of danger. Armed with its two shields, the dreadnought can present a'

 b'readnoughts presents a fierce face in either case.</p></div></div></div></di'
