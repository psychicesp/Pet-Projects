 b'hat lurks in subterranean and natural environments. It can change the color '
 b'and texture of its tough, outward-facing side to help it blend in with its s'
 b'urroundings, while its soft, inward-facing side clings to the floor, wall, o'
 b'r ceiling in its hunting territory. It remains motionless as it waits for pr'
 b'ey to come close. When a target is within its reach, it peels itself away fr'
 b'om the surface and wraps around its prey, crushing, smothering, and then dig'
 b'esting it.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b'

 b' can alter the color and texture of its outer side to match its surroundings'
 b'. It can blend in with any surface made of stone, earth, or wood, masking it'

 b'e to that of a grassy or snow-covered surface, but it can change its color t'
 b'o match and then conceal itself under a thin layer of vegetation or actual s'

 b'o eat about a halfling-sized meal once a week to remain sated. It is content'
 b' to stay in one place, given a steady supply of food, and thus trappers are '
 b'a threat along any well-traveled dungeon corridor and on routes through the '
 b'wilderness that see a lot of traffic. When prey is scarce, a trapper enters '
 b'a state of hibernation that can last for months, though it is still aware wh'
 b'en prey comes near. A trapper on the verge of starvation might defy its inst'
 b'incts and begin creeping along, abandoning its old territory in search of be'
 b'tter hunting.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd'

 b'hen its prey is dead, a trapper dissolves and absorbs the fleshy parts, leav'
 b'ing a scattering of bones, metal, treasure, and other indigestible bits in t'
 b'he place where the creature had been. A trapper that lurks on the floor of i'
 b'ts hunting grounds can cover these remains with own body, making them look l'
 b'ike irregularities in the surface. The creature might also attach itself to '
 b'a wall or a ceiling close to a recent kill, effectively using the remnants a'
 b's bait: a creature that stops to investigate the bones for valuables stands '
 b'a good chance of becoming the trapper\'s next meal.</p><div class="rd__sp'
