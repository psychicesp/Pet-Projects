They form no attachments, even to their parents and siblings, and have no concept of love or dedication. They worship the orc pantheon of gods-Gruumsh and Luthic foremost-because they believe that the gods have strength beyond reason, and physical might is all they respect.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5726"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Servants of Darkness.</span></span> <p>Mistrusted by orcs, some orogs form independent mercenary war bands that sell themselves to the highest bidder.

The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have take"

Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5729"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Tribes like Plagues.</span></span> <p>Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen.

 b'The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p><p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5730"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Ranging Scavengers.</span></span> <p> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets.

When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc.
