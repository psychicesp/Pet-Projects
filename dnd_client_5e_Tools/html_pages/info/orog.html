 b'n taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been set'
 b'tled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. '
 b'The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. G'
 b'rasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests af'
 b'lame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs,'

 b'. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and o'
 b'ther folk.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Orcs hold a particul'
