 b'</span> <p>A troll that is infused with waves of necrotic energy as it regen'
 b'erates can develop a symbiotic relationship with that deathly power. The tro'
 b"ll's body withers, and its flesh falls away from the body as quickly as it f"
 b'orms. Eventually a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though it still h'
 b'eals normally. The creature courses with necrotic energy that flows out of i'
 b'ts withered form. Simply standing near a rot troll exposes other creatures t'
 b'o its lethal emanations.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><di'

 b'ls that are nearly obliterated but survive and regenerate from mere scraps o'
 b'f flesh can display bizarre mutations. One of these warped trolls is especia'
 b'lly likely to arise if the creature regenerates in the presence of magical e'
 b'manations, planar energy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if its body '
 b'was damaged by elemental forces. These mutated forms can also be produced an'
 b'd shaped by the ritual magic of evil spellcasters.</p><div class="rd__spc-in'
