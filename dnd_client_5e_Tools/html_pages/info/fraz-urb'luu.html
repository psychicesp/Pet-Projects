 b'ception and Demon Lord of Illusions. He uses every trick, every ounce of dem'
 b'onic cunning, to manipulate his enemies\xe2\x80\x94mortal and fiend alike'
 b"\xe2\x80\x94to do his will. Fraz-Urb'luu can create dreamlands and mind-b"
 b'ending fantasies able to deceive the most discerning foes.</p><div class="rd'
 b'__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Once imprisoned for centuries below Castle Greyh'
 b"awk on the world of Oerth, Fraz-Urb'luu has slowly rebuilt his power in the "
 b'Abyss. He seeks the pieces of the legendary staff of power taken from him by'
 b' those who imprisoned him, and commands his servants to do likewise.</p><p>T'
 b"he Prince of Deception's true form is like that of a great gargoyle, some 12"
 b' feet tall, with an extended, muscular neck and a smiling face framed by lon'
 b'g, pointed ears and lank, dark hair, and bat-like wings are furled against h'
 b'is powerful shoulders. He can assume other forms, however, from the hideous '
 b'to the beautiful. Often the demon lord becomes so immersed in playing a role'
 b' that he loses himself in it for a time.</p><p>Many of the cultists of Fraz-'
 b"Urb'luu aren't even aware they serve the Prince of Deception, believing thei"
 b'r master is a beneficent being and granter of wishes, some lost god or celes'
 b"tial, or even another fiend. Fraz-Urb'luu wears all these masks and more. He"
 b' particularly delights in aiding demon-hunters against his demonic adversari'
 b'es, driving the hunters to greater and greater atrocities in the name of the'
 b'ir cause, only to eventually reveal his true nature and claim their souls as'
 b' his own.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__'
