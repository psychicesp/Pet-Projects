 b'e it is brought into existence, a pack must have a master, who is often some'
 b'one the creator wishes to reward. The master can telepathically communicate '
 b'with its yeth hounds to give them commands from afar. If the master of a pac'

 b' of a yeth hound has a human-like face, held up by a neck more flexible than'

 b'their ground and fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass thr'
