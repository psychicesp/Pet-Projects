 b'ubmit are subjected to an ancient ritual widespread among evil aquatic creat'

 b'ice to its underwater master, which is likely a kraken or some other ancient'
 b' being of the deep. While wearing the mind and body of the person it once wa'

 b'xpectedly found alive when all hope was lost. At other times the deep scion '
 b"takes on a new identity. In any case, it is the deep scion's duty to infiltr"
 b'ate the air-breathing world and report back to its master. When set to its t'
 b'ask, a deep scion worms its way into the life of an unsuspecting enemy as a '
 b'new best friend, an irresistible lover, the perfect candidate for a job, or '
 b"in some other role that enables the minion to carry out its master's command"

 b'uated, laugh at the joke of a friend, or appear incensed at some injustice, '
 b'each of these acts is artificial to the deep scion, a means to an end. It be'
 b'lieves that its true form is the shape it takes when it returns to the sea t'
 b'hat it thinks of as home. Ironically, however, a deep scion that is killed w'
 b'hen in its piscine form is stripped of the magic that robbed it of emotion, '
 b'leaving behind the corpse of the person the deep scion once was.</p><div cla'
