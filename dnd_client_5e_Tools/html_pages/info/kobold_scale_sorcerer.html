 b'an> <p> In a kobold tribe associated with a dragon, typically one that resid'
 b"es in or near the dragon's lair, the scale sorcerer also serves as diplomat "
 b"and mouthpiece-anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to other ko"
 b"bolds on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. "
 b'The sorcerer is just as awed by and respectful of dragons as common kobolds '
 b'are, but it knows that its duty requires it not to fawn over its master at a'
 b'll times. It also understands that its frequent proximity to the dragon mean'
 b's it would probably be the first to die if its master became angry or disple'
 b'ased, and so it frantically maintains a balance between adoration and terror'
 b' in its behavior toward the dragon.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></di'
