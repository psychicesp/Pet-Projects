Outside their home plane, they play among the burning skeletons of charred trees as forest fires rage around them, or slither down the slopes of erupting volcanoes to linger in fire pits and magma floes.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6627"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Fire Snakes.</span></span> <p>Salamanders hatch from eggs that are two-foot-diameter spheres of smoldering obsidian. When a salamander is ready to hatch, it melts its way through the egg's thick shell and emerges as a fire snake. A fire snake matures into a salamander adult within a year.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6628"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Slaves of the Efreet.</span></span> <p>Long ago, the efreet hired azers to build the fabled City of Brass, but then failed in their attempt to enslave that mystical race when the azers' work was done. Turning instead to strike against the salamanders, the efreet had better luck in establishing a slave race, which they use to unleash war and destruction across the planes.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Salamanders despise the azers, believing that if the efreet had succeeded in dominating that race of elemental crafters, the salamanders would still be free. The efreet use this enmity to their own advantage, stoking the salamanders' hatred and pitting them against the efreets' former servants.</p><p>The efreet suffer salamanders to serve no other master; when efreet encounter salamanders dedicated to the cults of Elemental Evil, they slay them rather than taking them as slaves.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="6629"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Domineering Nobles.</span></span> <p>Although salamanders follow the destructive impulses of their fiery nature, slavery under the efreet has impacted the culture of free salamanders.

Even approaching a salamander is dangerous, since flesh blisters and burns in its proximity.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>This inherent heat is an asset to salamanders' skill as smiths, allowing them to soften and shape iron and steel with their bare hands. Although not as meticulous as azers, salamanders number among the greatest metalsmiths in all the planes. Powerful creatures summon them as warriors, but others enlist the salamanders for their crafting skills, or bind them to forges and ovens to generate limitless heat.</p></div></div></div></td>')
