 b'y who betrayed the Summer Queen. His true name has been stricken from histor'
 b'y, but the stories call him Dubh Catha ("Dark Crow" in Common). So great was'
 b" the Summer Queen's wrath that she cursed every member of his house. Other f"
 b"ey refer to the descendants of Dubh Catha's house as the dubh sith-or, in Co"
 b'mmon, "darklings." Darklings most often settle in secluded caverns and chamb'
 b'ers beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, they quietly ply'
 b' their trade as thieves and assassins.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"><'

 b"pan></span> <p> The Summer Queen's curse causes a darkling's body to absorb "
 b'light, and doing so wizens the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging'
 b'. For this reason, darklings cover every part of their body with clothing wh'
 b'en exposure to light is a risk. The light a darkling absorbs over the course'
 b' of its lifetime explodes outward when the darkling dies, incinerating the c'
 b'reature and much of its possessions.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></d'

 b'y of art. A darkling might risk taking a peek at a sunset or lighting a tiny'
 b' candle to glimpse the colors in a painting or a jewel.</p><div class="rd__s'

 b'qualify to undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the suppli'
 b"cant with glowing tattoos, channeling some of the darkling's absorbed light "
 b'away from its body. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a tall a'
 b'nd fair form, like that of a gray-skinned elf. The darkling perishes if the '
 b'ritual fails.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></'
