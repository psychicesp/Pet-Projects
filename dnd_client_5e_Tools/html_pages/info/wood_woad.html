Performing the ritual isn'"
 b't necessarily an act of evil, if the victim-to-be has entered into a bargain that requires it to be a willing sacrifice.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>In the ritual a living person\'s chest is pierced and the heart removed. A seed is then pushed into the heart, and it is placed in a tree. Any hollow or crook will do, but often a special cavity is carved out of the trunk. The tree is then bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrificed victim, and the body is buried among the tree's roots. After three days"

The one who performed the ritual sets the wood woad to its task, and the creature follows those orders unceasingly.</p><p>Wood woads are drawn to creatures that have close ties to nature, and that protect and respect the land, such as druids and treants. Some treants have wood woad servants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids or fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire the services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose in the domain of a kindred guardian.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8731"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Pitiless Protectors.</span></span> <p> A wood woad has a hole where its heart would be, just as does the body of its former self, buried in the earth. Those who become wood woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment for supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They exist only to protect woodlands and the people who tend them. A wood woad's face is void and expre"
 b'ssionless, except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not being called upon to take action, they root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8732"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Uprooted by Immortality.</span></span> <p> Like a tree, a wood woad needs only sunlight, air, and nutrients from the earth to go on living. Because they are undying, some wood woads outlive their original purpose. The site a wood woad guards might lose its power or significance over time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might themselves die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a wood woad might roam to find another place of natural beauty or fey influence to watch over.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>')
