 b'ritual to create a wood woad is a primeval secret passed down through genera'
 b"tions of savage societies and dark druid circles. Performing the ritual isn'"
 b't necessarily an act of evil, if the victim-to-be has entered into a bargain'
 b' that requires it to be a willing sacrifice.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-p'
 b'ost"></div><p>In the ritual a living person\'s chest is pierced and the h'
 b'eart removed. A seed is then pushed into the heart, and it is placed in a tr'
 b'ee. Any hollow or crook will do, but often a special cavity is carved out of'
 b' the trunk. The tree is then bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrif'
 b"iced victim, and the body is buried among the tree's roots. After three days"
 b', a sprout emerges from the ground at the base of the tree and swiftly grows'
 b' into a humanoid form.</p><p>This new body, armored in tough bark and bearin'
 b'g a gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to perform its duty. The one w'
 b'ho performed the ritual sets the wood woad to its task, and the creature fol'
 b'lows those orders unceasingly.</p><p>Wood woads are drawn to creatures that '
 b'have close ties to nature, and that protect and respect the land, such as dr'
 b'uids and treants. Some treants have wood woad servants by virtue of age-old '
 b'pacts with druids or fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire th'
 b'e services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose in the domain of a '
 b'kindred guardian.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd'

 b'rt would be, just as does the body of its former self, buried in the earth. '
 b'Those who become wood woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment'
 b' for supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They exist only to protect '
 b"woodlands and the people who tend them. A wood woad's face is void and expre"
 b'ssionless, except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye sockets.'
 b' Wood woads speak little, and when not being called upon to take action, the'
 b'y root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it.</p><div'
