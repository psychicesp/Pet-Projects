 b' as deer, pixies go where they please. They like to spy on other creatures a'
 b'nd can barely contain their excitement around them. The urge to introduce th'
 b"emselves and strike up a friendship is almost overwhelming; only a pixie's f"
 b'ear of being captured or attacked stays its hand. Those who wander through a'
 b" pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet hear the occasional giggle"
 b', gasp, or sigh.</p><p>Pixies array themselves like princes and princesses o'
 b'f the fey, wearing flowing gowns and doublets of silk that sparkle like moon'
 b'light on a pond. Some dress in acorns, leaves, bark, and the pelts of tiny w'
 b'oodland beasts. They take great pride in their regalia and beam with joy whe'
 b'n they are complimented on their ensembles.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><'

 b'e the arrival of visitors piques their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reve'
 b'al themselves at first. They study the visitors from afar to gauge their tem'
 b'perament or play harmless tricks on them to measure their reactions. For exa'
 b"mple, pixies might tie a dwarf's boots together, create illusions of strange"
 b' creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to lead interlopers astray. I'
 b'f the visitors respond with hostility, the pixies give them a wide berth. If'
 b' the visitors are good natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened and m'
 b'ore friendly. The fey might even emerge and offer to guide their "guests" al'
 b'ong a safe route or invite them to a tiny yet satisfying feast prepared in t'
