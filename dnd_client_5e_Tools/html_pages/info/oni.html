 b'ng from their foreheads. Their eyes are dark with strikingly white pupils, a'
 b'nd their teeth and claws are jet black.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span'

 b' ability. Though they are only distantly related to true ogres, they share t'
 b"he ogres' habit of joining forces with other evil creatures. An oni serves a"
 b' master if doing so proves lucrative or provides it with a luxurious, well-d'
 b'efended home. Oni covet magic, and they work for evil wizards and hags in ex'
 b'change for useful magic items.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></d'
