 b"ng giant wrought of heavy metal. An iron golem's shape can be worked into an"
 b'y form, though most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its fis'
 b't can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the'
 b' earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their r'
 b"each, and all can belch clouds of deadly poison.</p><p>An iron golem's body "
 b'is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weak'
 b'nesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental spirit boun'
 b'd within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their ir'
 b'on bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to '
 b'weapons imbued with magic or the strength of adamantine.</p><div class="rd__'

 b"irit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creat"
 b'or.</p><p>A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item that al'
