On the rare occasion when two dreadnoughts meet, they typically fight until one tires of the conflict and departs.

What one sees reflected in that starry void is the sudden, terrifying realization of one's own mortality. Spellcasters have cause to fear the eye more than others, since it emits a continuous antimagic field. The dreadnought can shut off the effect by simply closing its eye, though it seldom has reason to do so.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="916"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Astral Predator.</span></span> <p>A remorseless, indiscriminate hunter, an astral dreadnought employs terrifying, if unimaginative, tactics. It uses its teeth and claws to tear apart its prey. Instinctively aware of how dangerous spellcasters can be, it maneuvers to keep as many opponents as possible within its antimagic gaze.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>An astral dreadnought doesn't have a gullet or a digestive system. Anything it swallows is deposited in a unique demiplane—an enclosed space that contains eons worth of detritus, as well as the remains of dead planar travelers. The place has gravity and breathable air, and organic matter decays there. Although escape from the demiplane is possible with the aid of magic, most creatures arrive here only after they have died. When the dreadnought dies, its demiplane vanishes, and its contents are released into the Astral Plane.</p><p>An astral dreadnought doesn't communicate. It simply consumes any prey it finds, then continues its silent patrol. It can't leave the Astral Plane, nor would it want to.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="917"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Titans of the Chained God.</span></span> <p>Tharizdun, the Chained God, created astral dreadnoughts to devour planar travelers who were seeking portals that lead from the Astral Plane to the Outer Planes—portals they might use to gaze upon their gods or realize some dream of godhood.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Astral dreadnoughts don't procreate, so their population can't grow.</p><p>Even though githyanki and other astral voyagers hunt the creatures, they rarely see any success, and the dreadnoughts aren't in danger of becoming extinct anytime soon.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="918"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Titanic Nature.</span></span> <p>Although it eats and sleeps if it so desires, an astral dreadnought doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>
