 b'ckster deity who was determined to get the last laugh. Although its essence '
 b'was shattered by Maglubiyet, this trickster god survives in splintered form '
 b'as a possessing spirit that arises when goblinoids form a host, causing diso'
 b'rder in the ranks unless it is appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity'
 b' and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush'
 b' it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, and the '
 b'goblin possessed by it, a nilbog ("goblin" spelled backward), and they revel'

 b'rless of reprisal. It gives the goblin strange powers that drive others to d'
 b'o the opposite of what they desire. Attacking a goblin possessed by a nilbog'
 b' is foolhardy, and killing the creature just prompts the spirit to possess a'
 b'nother goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat'

 b'> <p>A nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. Bereft of '

 b'ked. The only action it can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5 '
 b'feet of it.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A goblin targeted b'
 b'y the spirit must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possess'
 b"ed. While possessed by the spirit, the goblin's alignment becomes chaotic ev"
 b'il, its Charisma becomes 15 (unless it was already higher), and it gains the'
 b" nilbog's Innate Spellcasting and Nilbogism traits, as well as its Reversal "
 b"of Fortune reaction. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that gob"
 b'lin for 24 hours. If its host is killed or the possession is ended by a spel'
 b'l such as hallow, magic circle, or protection from evil and good, the spirit'
 b' searches for another goblin to possess. The spirit can leave its host at an'
 b"y time, but it won't do so willingly unless it knows there's another potenti"
 b'al host nearby. A goblin stripped of its nilbog spirit reverts to its normal'
 b' statistics and loses the traits it gained while possessed.</p></div></div><'
