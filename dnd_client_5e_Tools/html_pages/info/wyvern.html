 b'k-winged shape of a wyvern carrying its prey. These cousins to the great dra'

 b'vern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its m'
 b"ost potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can ki"
 b'll a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its '
 b"victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the he"
 b'art. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often tra'
 b'ck them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coa'
 b't weapons.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-'

 b'<p>Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the'
 b' intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain th'
 b'eir composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick i'

 b'ible ambushes.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h'
