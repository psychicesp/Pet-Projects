On the Material Plane, hell hounds are most commonly seen in service to devils, fire giants, and other evil creatures that use them as guard animals and companions.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3491"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Burning Hunger.</span></span> <p>Hell hounds hunt in packs, feeding on any creature that appears edible. They avoid potentially dangerous foes in favor of targeting the weakest prey with their savage bite and fiery breath, demonstrating a relentless determination as they pursue that prey to the bitter end.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>When hell hounds feed, the flesh they consume stokes the infernal fires that burn within them. When a hell hound dies, that fire consumes the creature's remains in a billowing eruption of smoke and blazing embers, leaving nothing behind but scorched tufts of black fur.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3492"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Evil to the Core.</span></span> <p>Hell hounds are smarter than mundane beasts, and their lawful nature makes them good at following orders. However, a hell hound's evil disposition means that the creature can't be trained to be anything other than a ruthless killer. If a hell hound isn't allowed to indulge its malevolent hunger, it quickly abandons or turns against its master.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
