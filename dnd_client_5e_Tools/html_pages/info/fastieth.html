 b'rightly colored and patterned scales, and strong legs. They are the most com'
 b'mon mounts of the halflings of the Talenta Plains, bred for speed. Although '
 b'too small to bear larger riders, a fastieth can carry a halfling with light '
 b'gear easily and at a good pace. Fastieths are typically stubborn creatures, '
 b'so specimens with an even temperament are prized among the Talenta tribes.</'
