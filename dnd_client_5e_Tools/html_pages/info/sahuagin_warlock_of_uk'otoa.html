<td class="text" colspan="6"><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><p>The slumbering leviathan Uk'otoa preys on the fears and ambitions of humanoids that brave th"
 b'e depths of the Lucidian Ocean. Countless communities of sahuagin inhabit uncharted pockets of water along the Menagerie Coast, and the most ambitious among them often hear the call of the leviathan in their dreams, urging them to take his power and use it to achieve their bloodsoaked dreams.</p><p>Sahuagin who answer the call of Uk'otoa tend to have one ambition in common: ven"
 b'geance against the land dwellers of the Clovis Concord for daring to sail oceans that do not belong to them. As these devotees receive dark boons from their leviathan lord, other sahuagin begin to gather to their side, drawn to their displays of power and seeking their own pathway to power. Over time, these warlocks eventually become empty husks, mere receptacles for Uk'otoa's "
 b'power, and puppets that the slumbering leviathan can control as he pleases.</p></div></td>')
