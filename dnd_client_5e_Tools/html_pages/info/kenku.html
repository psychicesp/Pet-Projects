They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4192"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Fallen Flocks.</span></span> <p>Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master's library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4193"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Speech in Pantomime.</span></span> <p> Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Kenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat\'s meow might be the secret code for "Prepare to attack!" or "Flee for your lives!" Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4194"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">The Wistful Wingless.</span></span> <p>All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
