 b'Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the sof'
 b't, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They '
 b'tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of tr'
 b'ees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as'
 b' not to draw attention to their shameful forms.</p><div class="rd__spc-inlin'

 b' gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whos'
 b'e identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering bau'
 b'bles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swi'
 b'ndle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volu'
 b"me in their master's library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for p"
 b'retty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away the'
 b'ir wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.</p><div class="rd__b rd'

 b'an mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might mak'
 b'e the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy mark'
 b'etplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleati'
 b'ng sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can o'
 b'nly repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To c'
 b'onverse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almo'
 b'st nonsensical verse.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Kenku spe'
 b'ak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreti'
 b"ng one another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate c"
 b'omplex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secre'
 b't codes. For example, a cat\'s meow might be the secret code for "Prepare'
 b' to attack!" or "Flee for your lives!" Their talent for mimicry extends to h'
 b'andwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents'
 b'. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another'
 b' creature.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd_'
