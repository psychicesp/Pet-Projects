 b' difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligen'
 b't creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an un'
 b'flinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlem'
 b'ents have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on '
