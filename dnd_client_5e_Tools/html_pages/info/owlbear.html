These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.</p><"

It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees.

 b'Owlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5762"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Savage Companions.</span></span> <p>Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owlbears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5763"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Owlbear Origins.</span></span> <p>Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear.
