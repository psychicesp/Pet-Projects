Its sole purpose is to hunt down creatures and retrieve objects for its summoner. When it is defeated or the magic that binds it expires, an invisible stalker vanishes in a gust of wind.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4006"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Directed Hunter.</span></span> <p>When an invisible stalker is created, it stays at its summoner's side until it is given a task to perform. If an assignment doesn't involve hunting down and slaying a specific creature or recovering an object, the magic that created the invisible stalker ends and the elemental is released. Otherwise, it completes the task, then returns to its summoner for more commands, forced to serve until the magic that binds it expires. If its summoner dies in the interim, the invisible stalker vanishes after completing its task.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>An invisible stalker is an unwilling servant at best. It resents any undertaking assigned to it. A mission that requires significant time might drive the invisible stalker to pervert the intent of a command unless it is worded carefully.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4007"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Unseen Threat.</span></span> <p>Invisible stalkers are composed of air and are naturally invisible. A creature might hear and feel an invisible stalker in passing, but the elemental remains invisible even when it attacks. A spell that allows someone to see the invisible reveals only the invisible stalker's vague outline.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4008"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Elemental Nature.</span></span> <p>An invisible stalker requires no air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
