 b'plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a se'
 b'ries of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give'

 b'h a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in col'
 b"or, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade w"
