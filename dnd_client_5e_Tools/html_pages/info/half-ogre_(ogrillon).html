 b's are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceiv'
 b"ed offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant"
 b'-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making'
 b' faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an '
 b'ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or crea'
 b'tures to smash.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>An ogre sleeps '
 b'in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated far'
 b'mhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is b'
 b'ored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that '
 b'crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it mo'
 b've on.</p><p>Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully o'
 b'r prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with gobli'
 b"noids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants' comp"
 b'lex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest g'
 b'iants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.<'

 b' taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner '
 b'with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If e'
 b'nough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make '
 b"a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. T"
 b'his macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.</p><div class="rd__spc-i'

 b'hich they fill with fabulous "treasure" taken from their victims. This might'

 b'patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig'
