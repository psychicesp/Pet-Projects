 b'rchdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted '
 b'devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the d'
 b'emotion is excessive.</p><p>No devil can promote or demote another devil tha'
 b't has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each'
