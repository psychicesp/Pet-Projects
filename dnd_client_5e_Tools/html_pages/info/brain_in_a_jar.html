 b'im surgical precision, the brain of a mortal being (willing or unwilling) is'
 b' encased in a glass jar filled with preserving fluids and the liquefied goop'
 b" of their body's flesh. The transformation renders the brain immortal and im"
 b'bues it with psionic power, so that it can spend eternity plotting and execu'
 b'ting its desires.</p><p>A brain in a jar can speak without vocal cords, psio'
 b'nically projecting its disembodied voice outward for all to hear. It enjoys '
 b'conversation so much that it is prone to talking for hours on end, sometimes'
 b' to itself if there are no others with whom it can speak. It also likes to t'
 b'hink out loud and reflect on the events and decisions that led to its great '
 b"transformation.</p><p>Being divorced from one's body can tax the mind, and t"
 b'he longer a brain in a jar exists, the more likely some form of insanity wil'
 b'l take hold of it. A brain in a jar is particularly susceptible to dementia,'
 b' schizophrenia, and paranoia.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><div class="rd_'

 b'Some brains have been known to thump against the walls of their containers w'
 b"hen excited or vexed. A jar's metal casing might be rusty but serviceable, o"
 b'r an elegantly wrought masterwork, depending on its creator. A brain in a ja'
 b'r weighs roughly 125 pounds.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div'
