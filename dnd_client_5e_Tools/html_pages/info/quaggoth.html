 b'hey were not always the brutal Underdark denizens they are today. In a dista'
 b'nt age, quaggoth tribes dwelled upon the surface as nocturnal arboreal hunte'
 b'rs, possessing their own language and culture. When elves appeared in the mo'
 b'rtal realm, they clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to near'
 b' extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the Underdark did the quaggoths survi'

 b'w realm transformed them. Turning increasingly brutal and savage, they ate w'
 b'hatever food they could find-and when they could not find it, they preyed on'
 b' each other. As cannibalism became part of their culture, their past was aba'
