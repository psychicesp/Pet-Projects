 b'dain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red drag'
 b'on, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beake'
 b'd snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is a'
 b'ngry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-bla'
