 b'anished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightl'
 b'ess caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the dro'
 b'w-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had n'

 b'The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating p'
 b'opulated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a spr'
 b'awling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct the'
 b'ir business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep g'
 b'iant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they dr'
 b'ape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch fl'
 b'ying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class="rd__sp'

 b'ife, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their '
 b'cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic it'
 b'ems, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrog'
 b'ant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p><di'
