Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8169"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Dark Desires.</span></span> <p>Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8170"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Born from Death.</span></span> <p>Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous cre"
