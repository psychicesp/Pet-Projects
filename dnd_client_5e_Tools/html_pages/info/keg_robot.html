 b'div><p>A keg robot is a stout wood-and-metal construct, vaguely reminiscent '
 b'of a dwarf wearing a horned helm and possessing a barrel for a body. These c'
 b'onstructs are another achievement of the Heuristic Arcane Research and Devel'
 b'opment (HARD) department of Acquisitions Incorporated. These devices have a '
 b'number of practical purposes, including the ability to be filled with a vari'
 b'ety of substances of use to an adventuring party. Specific models are nomina'
 b'lly named for their primary function, including "ambulatory fermenter," "mob'
 b'ile alchemical dispensary," and so forth. But their prominent use as portabl'
 b'e beer dispensers has placed the name "keg robot" firmly into public conscio'
 b'usness.</p><p>A keg robot can hold up to three different kinds of liquid in '
 b'its body cavity, from water and other potables to alchemical substances and '
 b'lamp oil. Its individual storage compartments can leak, providing drinkable '
 b'liquids with a unique but mostly safe flavor. These constructs have a rudime'
 b'ntary intellect that allows them to operate independently and discern friend'
 b' from foe-and which sometimes causes them to operate with a crass sense of h'
 b'umor that has never been fully explained.</p></div></div></div></td>')
