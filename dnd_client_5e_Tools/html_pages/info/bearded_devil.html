 b'be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing '
 b'the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil'

 b'soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immor'
 b'tal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a de'
 b"vil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Ni"
