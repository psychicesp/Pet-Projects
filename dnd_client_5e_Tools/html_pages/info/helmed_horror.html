 b' takes more magical resources to create a helmed horror than a lesser suit o'
 b'f animated armor, the helmed horror requires less direction and maintenance '
 b'as it carries out its appointed tasks. A helmed horror follows its orders wi'
 b'th complete loyalty, and is intelligent enough to understand the difference '
 b"between an order's intent and its exact wording. Unlike many constructs, it "
 b'seeks to fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter.</p><div'
