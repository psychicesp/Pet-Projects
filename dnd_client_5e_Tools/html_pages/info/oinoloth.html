 b'/span> <p>Grim specters of death, oinoloths bring pestilence wherever they g'
 b'o. To armies who recognize their awful forms, their mere appearance causes s'

 b'noloths provide the ultimate solution to thorny problems, usually by killing'
 b' everyone involved. They are hired as a last resort, when a siege has gone o'
 b'n too long or an army has proved too strong to overcome. Once summoned, oino'
 b'loths stalk the killing field, poisoning the ground and sickening creatures '
 b'they encounter. Sometimes they might be hired to lift the very plagues they '
 b'spread, but the price for such work is high, and the effort turns the creatu'
 b'res they save into debilitated wrecks.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3">'
