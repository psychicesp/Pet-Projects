 b'p> The first leucrottas came into being alongside the gnolls during Yeenoghu'
 b"'s rampages on the Material Plane. Some of the hyenas that ate Yeenoghu's ki"
 b'lls went through different transformations rather than turning into gnolls. '
 b'Among these bizarre results, leucrottas were the most numerous.</p><div clas'

 b' to deceive, torture, and kill. Because leucrottas are smarter and tougher t'
 b'han most gnolls, one could occupy an elevated position within a gnoll tribe.'
 b' Although a leucrotta is unlikely to lead a group of gnolls, it can influenc'
 b'e the leader, and it might even agree to carry a leader into battle and offe'
 b'r advice during the fight.</p><p>Gnolls see leucrottas as a form of entertai'
 b'nment, partly because a leucrotta can mimic the squeals of a suffering victi'
 b'm-a sound that always gives gnolls pleasure-even when no victims are to be h'
 b'ad. Further, a gnoll is bloodthirsty and sadistic, but unable by its nature '
 b'to prolong the fun of killing. Most leucrottas are consciously cruel, to the'
 b' point of being meticulous about their savagery to draw out a kill into bett'
 b'er and longer sport. Gnolls enjoy watching a leucrotta work almost as much a'
 b"s they like doing their own killing.</p><p>A leucrotta's stench would normal"
 b'ly warn away prey long before the creature could attack. It has two natural '
 b"capabilities, however, that give it an advantage. First, a leucrotta's track"
 b's are nearly impossible to distinguish from those of common deer. Second, it'
 b' can duplicate the call or the vocal expressions of just about any creature '
 b'it has heard. The monster uses its mimicry to lure in potential victims, the'
 b'n attacks when they are confused or unaware of the actual threat.</p></div><'

 b'span> <p> The leucrotta is so loathsome that only gnolls and others of its k'
 b'ind can stand to be around one for long. Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes'
 b' a foul stench that pollutes anywhere the creature lairs. This reek is outdo'
 b"ne only by the creature's breath, which issues from a maw that drips fluid c"
 b'orrupted with rot and digestive juices. In place of fangs, a leucrotta has b'
 b'ony ridges as hard as steel that can crush bones and lacerate flesh. These p'
 b'lates are so tough that a leucrotta can use them to peel plate armor away fr'
 b'om the body of a slain knight.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></d'
