 b'rnus after the cautious Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to la'
 b'unch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now Bel advises her and help'

 b'lls must pass through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this layer. '
 b'Here, the amnizus guard the citadels overlooking the River Styx, much of the'
 b' fighting of the Blood War takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abys'
 b's. Anyone hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend with the darkn'
 b'ess of this layer and the myriad threats it houses. Zariel manages it all an'
 b'd has the ultimate say over who comes and goes.</p><p>Given her role in the '
 b'Blood War, Zariel is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest'
 b' warriors on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She bargains har'
 b'd, and mortals end up worse for dealing with her, because she holds all the '
 b'cards. A bargain with Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling o'
 b'ut of it.</p><p>However, she does expect the best from her servants, and so '
 b'she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives, ever honing their t'
 b'alents, so she can put them to the best use when she finally calls in their '
 b"debts. As a result, Zariel's servants are universally effective, disciplined"
 b', and dangerous.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd_'
