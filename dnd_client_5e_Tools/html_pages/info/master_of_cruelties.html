Demons are strongly associated with the Cult of Rakdos; in fact, the demons of Ravnica might have been created by Rakdos in the same way that angels were created by the Boros Legion's founder. As a demon lord who has chosen to live in Ravnica, Rakdos claims authority over all the demons of this world-even if some of them, ambitious and headstrong as demons are, rebel against his authority.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Demons are agents of destruction that work their acts of terror in plain sight under the auspices of the Cult of Rakdos. They exhibit their cruelty in dramatic performances that leave the audience members blood-soaked but ecstatic. They incite mob riots that raze entire city blocks. The only thing demons fear is Rakdos himself, who doesn't tolerate rivals and hates to be upstaged.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4859"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Demonic "Devils.".</span></span> <p>The creatures called "devils" in Ravnica are minor demons akin to <a data-vet-hash="quasit_mm" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" href="bestiary.html#quasit_mm" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">quasits</a>.
