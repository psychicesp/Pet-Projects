(b'<td class="text" colspan="6"><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><p>To populate the '
 b'demiplane without endangering any innocents, the Harpers created constructs '
 b'out of wooden mannequins to act as villagers. Magic makes them look like fle'
 b'sh-and-blood people, and the constructs conduct themselves as convincingly r'
 b'eal humanoids who are simply living their lives in Wisteria Vale. Detect mag'
 b'ic spells do not reveal their true nature, as each construct is shielded by '
 b'a spell that makes it seem nonmagical.</p><p>Though these constructed villag'
 b'ers can physically interact with the environment around them and hold length'
 b'y conversations, a few clues to their true nature exist. A character who obs'
 b'erves one or more of the commoners closely and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (P'
 b'erception) check notices a faint clicking sound whenever a villager touches '
 b'a hard surface. The villagers are also cold to the touch, which can be ascer'
 b'tained only through physical contact. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wi'
 b'sdom (Insight) check notices that if the villagers are asked about anything '
 b'outside Wisteria Vale or their individual talents, they quickly change subje'
 b'cts to small talk about the weather or gossip, and always in Common regardle'
 b"ss of their apparent origin.</p><p>Constructed commoners don't bleed or feel"
 b" pain like flesh-and-blood humanoids. If a villager's hit points drop to 0, "
 b'its true form is revealed: that of a lifeless wooden mannequin. Overnight, t'
 b'he mannequin disappears, and a replacement villager is generated by the demi'
 b'plane to take over the "slain" villager\'s place and role in the village '
 b'a few days later. If the mannequin is disintegrated or reduced to ashes, it '
 b'is not replaced and the population of the village permanently decreases by o'
 b'ne.</p></div></td>')
