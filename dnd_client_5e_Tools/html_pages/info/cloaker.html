 b'cle. With its tail and fins unfurled, it flies through darkness and lurks am'
 b'ong the shadows of caverns the same way a stingray glides through water and '
 b'hides on the ocean floor. Parallel rows of round, black eyespots run along i'
 b'ts back like buttons, and the ivory-colored claws on its cowl resemble bone '
 b'clasps.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>When a cloaker unfurls '

 b'g the Underdark. They follow parties of humanoids to prey on the wounded aft'
 b'er a battle, or pursue herds of Underdark beasts, attacking the sick, the we'

 b'ke tail for defense, although it rarely takes a stand against dangerous foes'
 b' or groups of creatures. As an added defense, cloakers can create illusory d'
 b'uplicates of themselves.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="r'
