 b"d settlements sheltered from the worst of nature's abuse, including mountain"
 b' valleys, soaring plateaus, and desert oases. In these seemingly idyllic hid'
 b'eaways, the yakfolk rule over humanoid slaves with iron fists. For all their'
 b' learning and culture, yakfolk are enormously evil overlords. They care for '
 b'their hapless subjects only to the extent that a live slave is more useful t'
 b"han a dead one, and keeping one alive is easier than laboring oneself. It's "
 b'not that yakfolk are lazy-quite the contrary. They simply consider most meni'
 b'al tasks beneath them.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Outsider'

 b'learning, particularly when it comes to the secrets of elemental magic and d'
 b'ark knowledge that might serve to corrupt or dominate others. Knowledge that'
 b" the yakfolk can't gain or use is to be destroyed. Unsentimental by nature, "
 b'yakfolk parents pack children off to communal creches once they are weaned, '
 b'never to recognize them again. Yakfolk feel no loyalty to their families-onl'
 b'y to their god and race.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="r'

 b'a malignant theocracy in service to the Forgotten God. The worship of this s'
 b'avage, nameless deity directs their lives. The god takes the form of a male '
 b"Yikaria, but the deity's face is worn smooth into a featureless mask. The de"
 b'ity is appeased by sacrifice, which the followers carry out by offering slav'
 b'es in the Manner Elemental-that is, by fire (immolation), earth (live burial'
 b'), water (drown ing), or air (throwing the victim off a great height). Sac r'
 b'ifices are meant to ensure the benevolence of the deity and to punish disobe'
 b'dient slaves.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The Forgotten God'

 b'tion, defeated the Grand Khan of the dao. The price of that defeat was harsh'
 b': the dao were forced to serve the Forgotten God and its minions-and forbidd'
 b'en to attack them-"for a thousand years and a year." The sentence has since '
 b'expired, and yakfolk can no longer summon dao as they once did, but fear of '
 b'the Forgotten God has kept the dao from seeking vengeance.</p></div><div cla'
