Hunters might be lulled into a false sense of confidence upon sighting this ponderous, seemingly nonhostile creature. If any other creature large enough to be a threat approaches too close, though, the snail unleashes a flash of scintillating light and then attacks with its mace-like tentacles.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2277"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Trail of Treasure.</span></span> <p> Left undisturbed, a flail snail moves slowly along the ground, consuming everything on the surface, including rocks, sand, and soil, stopping to relish crystal growths and other large mineral deposits. It leaves behind a shimmering trail that quickly solidifies into a thin layer of a nearly transparent substance inedible to the snail. This glassy residue can be harvested and cut to form window panes of varying clearness. It can also be heated and spun into glass objects of other sorts. Some humanoids make a living from trailing flail snails to collect this glass.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b-inset"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="2278"><span class="entry-title-inner">Using the Shell of a Flail Snail</span></span><p>A flail snail shell, which weighs about 250 pounds, has numerous uses.
