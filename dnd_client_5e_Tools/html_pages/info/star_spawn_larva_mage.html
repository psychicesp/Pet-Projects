Beyond the best-known planes of existence lie realms that are lethal to mortal life. Some are so hostile that even a moment's contact with such a place is enough to plunge a mortal mind into madness. Yet beings do exist that are native to these realms: beings that are eternally hungering, searching, warring, sometimes dreaming. These Elder Evils are far older than most of the mortal races and always horrific to humanoid minds.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>However much they might desire to enter and dominate the Material Plane, the Elder Evils are unable or unwilling to leave their realms. Some are imprisoned in their dimensions by external forces, some are inextricably bound to their home realities, and others simply can\'t find any way out.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7257"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Heralds of Doom.</span></span> <p>The creatures known as star spawn are the heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the Elder Evils, capable of taking on forms that can journey to the Material Plane. They arrive most often in the wake of a comet\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps such a phenomenon merely signals that star spawn are in the vicinity and available for communication. When the signs are right, warlocks and cultists hasten to gather together, read aloud their blasphemous texts, and conduct the mind-searing rituals that guide the blazing star spawn into the world.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><p class="rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last">\xe2\x80\x9c<i>The cultists who blaspheme reality by calling out to Elder Evils often speak of a Far Realm from which these entities hail.
