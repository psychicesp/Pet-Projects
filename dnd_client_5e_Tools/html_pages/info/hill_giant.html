 b'o be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and'

 b'the hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fie'
 b'lds and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will cons'
 b'ume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, t'
 b'hen tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand,'

 b'/span> <p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, '

 b'lture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over'
 b' territory and ambition to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structu'
 b're called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordni'
 b'ng assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the or'
 b'dning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, sinc'
 b'e no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different comb'
 b'ination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelli'
 b'ng in these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level'
 b' of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status'
 b'. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fir'
 b'e giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin suc'
 b"h as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among "
 b'its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common'
 b' of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the hig'
 b"hest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespec"
 b't or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.</p></div><div class="'

 b'As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with'

 b'Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fir'

 b" their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worsh"
