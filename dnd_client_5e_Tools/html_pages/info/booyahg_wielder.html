 b' typically lack the intelligence and patience needed to learn and practice w'
 b'izardry, and they fare poorly even when given access to the necessary traini'
 b'ng and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among them than in many other'
 b' races, and Khurgorbaeyag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his'
 b' followers. And although many goblins would readily offer anything to have t'
 b'he abilities of a warlock, the patrons that grant such power know a goblin i'
 b's unlikely to be able to uphold its end of any bargain.</p><p>Even when a go'
 b'blin is born with the ability to become a spellcaster, the knowledge and tal'
 b'ent necessary to carry on the tradition rarely persists for more than a coup'
 b'le of generations. Because they have so little experience with magic, goblin'
 b's make no distinction between its forms. To them all magic is "booyahg," and'
 b' the word is part of the name they give to any of its practitioners.</p><p>A'
 b' goblin with access to booyahg becomes a member of the lashers and can often'
 b' rise to the role of boss.</p></div></td>')
