They are occasionally joined by cyclopes, ettins, fomorians, and ogres. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban development that encroaches on the wilds where they once lived-not least because they have so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through buildings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possible. They often armor themselves with pieces of buildings and wield columns or other architectural elements as clubs.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7475"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Giants.</span></span> <p>Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds.
