 b'hat encroaches on the wilds where they once lived-not least because they hav'
 b'e so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in de'
 b'stroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through bui'
 b'ldings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possi'
 b'ble. They often armor themselves with pieces of buildings and wield columns '
 b'or other architectural elements as clubs.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--'
