 b' end of the Last War, most Karrnathi undead have been sealed in vaults below'

 b'service, while others have been commandeered by the malevolent Order of the '

 b'e, and its soldiers are unmatched in discipline. But in the early years of t'
 b'he Last War, Karrnath was crippled by famine and plague. In desperation, Kin'
 b'g Kaius I embraced the Blood of Vol, whose priests bolstered the armies of K'
 b'arrnath with undead.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Initially,'
 b' those skeletons and zombies required constant control and served as cannon '
 b'fodder. Over decades, a high priest named Malevanor worked with the necroman'
 b'cers of the Blood of Vol to develop the Odakyr Rites, which grant Karrnathi '
 b'undead the ability to make tactical decisions and operate without direct gui'
 b'dance.</p><p>The Odakyr Rites work only when performed on the remains of a s'
 b'oldier slain in battle, and only in manifest zones tied to the plane of Maba'
 b'r. The most significant such zones in Karrnath exist in the cities of Atur a'
 b'nd Odakyr (now called Fort Bones). The number of Karrnathi undead soldiers s'
 b"teadily increased over the course of the war, with the losses of Karrnath's "
 b'living troops offset by the recovery and raising of their remains.</p><p>Mal'
 b'evanor claimed that Karrnathi undead are animated and granted intelligence b'
 b'y the patriotic spirit of Karrnath. However, many Karrns fear that the undea'
 b'd are vessels for a darker power\xe2\x80\x94and that Lady Illmarrow or so'
 b'meone else will turn the undead against the living.</p></div><div class="rd_'
