 b'all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a rav'
 b'ening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy '
 b'appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire fe'
 b'atures suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope r'
 b'esembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eye'
 b's show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dar'
 b'k.</p><p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form a'
 b't night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good l'
 b'ycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures'
 b', often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.</p><di'

 b'e it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and'
 b' personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, bur'
 b'ying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon ri'
 b'ses, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual int'
 b'o its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and hum'
 b'anoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once a'
 b'gain. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it migh'
 b't not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often'
 b' haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little poi'
 b'nt in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience,'
 b' they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form '
 b'or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures'
 b' succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on t'
 b'he weak.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b-inset"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2'
