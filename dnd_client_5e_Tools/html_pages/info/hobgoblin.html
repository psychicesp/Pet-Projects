 b'oot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front line'
 b's at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serv'
 b'ing under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interes'
 b'ted in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troop'
 b's into battle.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>As loyal and dis'
 b'ciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete consta'
