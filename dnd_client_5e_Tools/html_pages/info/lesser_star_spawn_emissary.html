 b'of order, trust, and reality on global scales, readying worlds for sanity-sh'
 b'attering revelations and cascading apocalypses. Only when truly threatened, '
 b'or when their foes have lost all hope, do emissaries reveal their actual, im'

 b'm suited to infiltration and a greater, physically overwhelming form. To des'
 b'troy an emissary, characters must reduce each of its forms to 0 hit points o'
 b'ne after another. Typically, a star spawn emissary is initially encountered '
 b"in its lesser form. When this form is destroyed, the emissary's body collaps"
 b'es into a gory slurry. It then instantly returns in its greater form. Only i'
 b'f the emissary is defeated in its greater form does the star spawn die.</p><'
 b'p>After finishing a long rest, a greater star spawn emissary regains its les'
 b'ser form if it was destroyed. When an emissary transitions from one form to '
 b'another, it loses all the traits and actions of the previous form and gains '
 b'those of the new form.</p></div></div></div></td>')
