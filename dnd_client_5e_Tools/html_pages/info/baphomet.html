 b'pan> <p>Civilization is weakness and savagery is strength in the credo of Ba'
 b'phomet, the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts. He rules over minotaurs an'
 b'd others with savage hearts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the '
 b'confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for Baphomet envisio'
 b'ns a world without restraint, where creatures live out their most savage des'
 b'ires.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Cults devoted to Baphomet'
 b' use mazes and complex knots as their emblems, creating secret places to ind'
 b'ulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their master favors. Blood'
 b'stained crowns and weapons of iron and brass decorate their profane altars.<'
 b"/p><p>Over time, Baphomet's cultists become tainted by his influence, gainin"
 b'g bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout '
 b'from the forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into '
 b'a minotaur\xe2\x80\x94considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beast'
 b's.</p><p>Baphomet appears as a great, black-furred minotaur, 20 feet tall wi'
 b'th six iron horns. An infernal light burns in his red eyes. Although he is f'
 b'illed with bestial blood lust, there lies within him a cruel and cunning int'
 b'ellect devoted to subverting all of civilization.</p><p>Baphomet wields a gr'
 b'eat glaive called Heartcleaver. He sometimes casts this deadly weapon aside '
 b'so that he can charge his enemies and gore them with his horns, trampling th'
 b'em into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.</p></div></d'
