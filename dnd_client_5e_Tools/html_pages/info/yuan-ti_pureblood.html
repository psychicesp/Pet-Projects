 b'f civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serp'
 b"ent's sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Thei"
 b'r advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of cl'
 b'ear, focused thought.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Yuan-ti c'
 b'ulture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legend'
 b'ary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of'
 b' ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longe'
 b'd to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant '
 b'voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must '
 b'do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound th'
 b'emselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulgi'
 b'ng in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti '
 b'bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serp'
 b'ent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.</p><p>Yuan-ti know that'
 b" the world they hope to rule can't be bound for long by brute force, and tha"
 b't many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence '
 b'other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humano'
 b'id cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that'
 b' a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so onl'
 b'y as part of a grander design.</p><p>Yuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthles'
 b's tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justi'
 b'fies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in'
 b' decisive ambush if they can.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span cla'
