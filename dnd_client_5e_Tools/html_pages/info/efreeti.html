Fine silk caftans and damask robes drape their magma-red or coal-black skin, and they bedeck themselves in brass and gold torcs, chains, and rings, all glittering with jewels. When an efreeti flies, its lower body transforms into a column of smoke and embers.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1872"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Haughty and Cruel.</span></span> <p>The efreet are deceptive, cunning, and cruel to the point of ruthlessness.

They raid the Material Plane and the elemental planes for slaves, which they capture and bring back to their homes on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The efreet rule as oppressive tyrants, promoting only the cruelest among their slaves.

Their love of the "

Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1876"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Creatures of the Elements.</span></span> <p> A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and apparent gender, a"
 b's well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate w"
 b'ith other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.</p><p>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.</p><p>In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.</p><p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden t"
 b"o any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie'"
 b's will and risk the consequences.</p><p>Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down before them.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1877"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Rule or Be Ruled.</span></span> <p> Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music t"
 b"o a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are"
 b' proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1878"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Decadent Nobility.</span></span> <p> Noble genies are the rarest of their kind.
