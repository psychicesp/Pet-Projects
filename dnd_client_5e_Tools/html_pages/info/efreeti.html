 b'</span></span> <p> A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creatu'
 b're melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare c'
 b'ircumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest fo'
 b'rm and create a genie.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A genie '
 b'usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force'
 b" is a building block that determines the genie's form and apparent gender, a"
 b's well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid'
 b" beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate w"
 b'ith other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out '
 b'of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie '
 b'with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child w'
 b'ith a mortal, although such offspring are rare.</p><p>When a genie perishes,'
 b' it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with'
 b' a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flas'
 b'h of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.</p><p>In contrast to thei'
 b'r love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A ge'
 b'nie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All ge'
 b'nies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess '
 b'the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek t'
 b'o bind genies into service.</p><p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and en'
 b'vy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other '
 b'genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is t'
 b"o defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden t"
 b"o any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie'"
 b's will and risk the consequences.</p><p>Their miraculous powers, the grandeu'
 b'r of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to dece'
 b'ive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so f'
 b'ar as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds'
 b'-bow down before them.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd_'

 b"genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music t"
 b"o a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are"
 b' proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, an'
 b'd a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a resul'
 b't, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of th'
 b'eir households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but neve'
 b'r to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.</p><div class="rd__spc'
