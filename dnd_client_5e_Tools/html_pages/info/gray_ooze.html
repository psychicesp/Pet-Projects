 b'uddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only u'
 b"pside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the re"
 b'scue before it is too late.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Sin'

 b's true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control o'
 b'ozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes '
 b'have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictab'
 b'le, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they'
 b' exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.</p></div><div class="r'

 b'lthough an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, '
 b"others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location "
 b'where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend '
 b'passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit t'
 b'rap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after '
 b'them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas'
