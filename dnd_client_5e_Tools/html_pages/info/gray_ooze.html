Oozes "
 b'are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal.

Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3114"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Unwitting Servants.</span></span> <p> Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location "

Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3115"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Spawn of Juiblex.</span></span> <p> According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3116"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Ooze Nature.</span></span> <p> An ooze doesn\'t require sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>')
