It has beady, bloodshot eyes and a forked tongue, and smells faintly of rotting meat. Broodguards can speak but rarely do so, preferring to use snake-like hisses and guttural noises.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="9175"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Making a Broodguard.</span></span> <p>Yuan-ti create broodguards from captured humanoids.
