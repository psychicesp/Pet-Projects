 b' bloody conflict with his more civilized neighbors, Obould did the unthinkab'
 b'le and brokered a peace treaty with his enemies. This treaty confused many o'
 b"f the orcs under Obould's command. It was either a clever ploy by Obould to "
 b'buy time while he strengthened his army for a final, decisive sweep across t'
 b'he Savage Frontier, or it was a troubling sign that Obould had forsaken the '
 b'ways of Gruumsh and needed to be destroyed.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><'

 b'/span> <p> Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their '
 b'creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide '
 b'the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he lear'
 b'ned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but th'
 b'ose had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had alread'
 b'y been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a f'
 b'urious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, se'
 b't the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the r'
 b'ole of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races'
 b' would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves'
 b', dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Orcs'

 b"linded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, th"
 b'e orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury i'
 b'nto a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingl'
