 b's originally devised by the cult of Tiamat, but has spread to other groups t'
 b'hat are skilled in arcana and associated with dragons. The cooperation of a '
 b'dragon is necessary for the ritual to succeed, and a dragon typically provid'
 b'es its help when it wants to reward its allies or worshipers with a valuable'
 b' servant.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The ritual, which tak'
 b'es several days, requires 10 pounds of fresh dragon scales (donated by the d'
 b'ragon allied with the group), a large amount of fresh meat, and an iron caul'
 b'dron. When the process is complete, a halfling-sized egg emerges from the ca'
 b'uldron and is ready to hatch within a few hours.</p><p>A guard drake resembl'
 b'es the type of dragon it was created from, but with a wingless, squat, muscu'
 b"lar build. A drake can't reproduce, nor can its scales be used to make other"
 b' guard drakes.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h'
