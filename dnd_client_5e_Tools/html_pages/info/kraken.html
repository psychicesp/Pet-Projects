 b"ning of time, krakens served as fierce warriors of the gods. When the gods' "
 b'wars ended, the krakens shrugged free of their servitude, never again to be '
 b'bound by other beings. Whole nations quake in fear when the kraken emerges f'
 b'rom its dark demesne, and even in the middle of the deepest oceans, storms r'
 b'ise or abate according to its will. The kraken is a primeval force that obli'
 b'terates the greatest achievements of civilization as if they were castles in'
 b' the sand. Its devastating attacks can destroy ocean trade and halt communic'
 b'ation between coastal cities.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A'

 b'lors the water around it. Galleons and warships vanish when its tentacles un'
 b'coil from the deep, the kraken breaking their masts like kindling before dra'
 b'wing down ships and crew. Not even landlocked surface dwellers are safe from'
 b" a kraken's wrath. Krakens can breathe air as easily as water, and some craw"
 b'l up rivers to nest in freshwater lakes, destroying cities and towns along t'
 b'he way. Adventurers tell of these monsters lairing in the ruins of lakeside '
 b'citadels, their tentacles twined around leaning towers of disintegrating sto'
