 b'<p>A draegloth is an ogre-sized, four-armed humanoid with purple-black skin '
 b'and yellow-white hair. Two of its arms are huge and muscular, tipped with sh'
 b'arp claws; the other two are the size and shape of drow arms, capable of del'
 b'icate movements. Although the creature is heavily muscled, it is graceful an'
 b'd quiet like a drow. Its face is clearly demonic, with bestial features, glo'
 b'wing red eyes, an elongated dog-like snout, and a mouth full of sharp teeth.'

 b'</span></span> <p> The ritual to create a draegloth succeeds only rarely, bu'
 b't when it does, it is a great event that is seen by the drow of the house as'
 b" a sign of the demon lord Lolth's favor-and a sign of Lolth's disregard for "
 b"the family's rivals, which were not thus gifted. The birth prompts the leade"
 b'rs of the house to begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the'
 b' draegloth is fully grown. These plans always use the draegloth in a signifi'
 b'cant role, because its abilities can turn the tide in a battle against a hou'
 b'se that doesn\'t have a draegloth of its own.</p><div class="rd__spc-inli'

 b' Although it plays an important part in the welfare of its house, a draeglot'
 b"h can't rise above the status of a favored slave or a consort to a priestess"
 b'. Before a draegloth is given any duties, it receives instruction in accepti'
 b'ng the role set for it and not challenging authority. Draegloths instinctive'
 b'ly resist this sort of treatment, but most of them take out their frustratio'
 b"n on their house's enemies. A draegloth that can't suppress its ambitions mi"
 b'ght abandon its house and strike out on its own. Whether these rebellious dr'
 b"aegloths are part of Lolth's plan for sowing even greater chaos is unclear.<"
