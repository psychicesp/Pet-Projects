 b'inds are networked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which each modron receives co'
 b'mmands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron carries o'
 b'ut commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of moral'
 b'ity or ego. Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to fulfil'
 b'l their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet th'
 b'ey always refer to themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no "I," bu'
 b't only "we" or "us."</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Variant: R'
