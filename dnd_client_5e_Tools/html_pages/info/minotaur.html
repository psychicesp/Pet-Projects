 b'a battering ram, then chopping the fallen in twain.</p><p>Apart from ambushi'

 b'nimals are exchanged for humanoid sacrifice-sometimes an inductee that tried'

 b"d-soaked halls of slaughter, echoing to the cultists' savagery.</p><p>Unknow"
 b'n to all but their highest-ranking leaders, these mystery cults are creation'
 b's of the demon lord Baphomet, the Horned King, whose layer of the Abyss is a'
 b' gigantic labyrinth. Some of his followers are fervent supplicants that plea'
 b'd for strength and power. Others come to the cult seeking a life free from a'
 b"uthority's chains-and are liberated of their humanity instead as Baphomet tr"
 b'ansforms them into the minotaurs that echo his own savage form.</p><p>Althou'
