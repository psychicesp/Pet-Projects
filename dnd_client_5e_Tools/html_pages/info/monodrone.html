 b'he multiverse in accordance with laws beyond the comprehension of mortal min'
 b'ds. Their own minds are networked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which each mod'
 b'ron receives commands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A m'
 b'odron carries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an a'
 b'bsence of morality or ego. Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is nece'
 b'ssary to fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided b'
 b'y ranks, yet they always refer to themselves collectively. To a modron, ther'
 b'e is no "I," but only "we" or "us."</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></di'
