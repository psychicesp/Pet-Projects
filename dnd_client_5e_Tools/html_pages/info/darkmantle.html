 b'l as it waits for creatures to pass beneath it. From a distance, it can pass'
 b' itself off as a stalactite or a lump of stone. Then it drops from the ceili'
 b'ng and unfurls, surrounding itself with magical darkness as it engulfs and c'
 b'rushes its prey.</p><p>Darkmantles are found throughout the Underdark, but t'
 b'hey are equally common on the Shadowfell. Thriving in that dark realm, they '
 b'fill an ecological niche similar to bats on the Material Plane. Intelligent '

 b'anions.</p></div></div></td>')
