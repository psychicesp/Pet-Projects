 b'hings that make them sick. They consume spoiled food and diseased carcasses '
 b'with as much enthusiasm as children eating dessert. Fortunately for hill gia'
 b"nts, they have a vulture's constitution and rarely suffer for such eating ha"
 b'bits. This makes it all the more mysterious to them when one of their kind b'
 b'ecomes ill and incapable of keeping down food. Vomiting hill giants are seen'

 b'ing the giant in a cage or tying the giant to a post. A priest of Grolantor '
 b'or chieftain visits the famished giant daily, trying to read portents in the'
 b' puddles of bile the hill giant retched up. If the sickness soon passes, the'
 b' hill giant can rejoin society. If not, the hill giant is instead starved to'
 b" the point of madness so that Grolantor's hunger can be given a mouth in the"

 b'o be an individual and becomes an object. Paradoxically, that object is reve'
 b"red as a holy embodiment of Grolantor's eternal, aching hunger. Unlike a typ"
 b'ical thick, sluggish, half-asleep hill giant, a mouth of Grolantor is thin a'
 b's a whippet, alert like a bird, and constantly twitching around the edges. A'
 b' mouth of Grolantor is kept perpetually imprisoned or shackled; if it breaks'
 b" free, it's sure to kill a few hill giants before it's brought down or it sp"
 b'rints away on a killing spree. The only time a mouth of Grolantor is set loo'
 b'se is during a war, a raid against an enemy settlement, or in a last-ditch d'
 b"efense of the tribe's home. When the mouth of Grolantor has slaughtered and "
 b"eaten its fill of the tribe's enemies, it passes out amid the gory remains o"
 b'f its victims, making it easy to recapture.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-po'
