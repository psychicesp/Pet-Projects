Others claim these creatures were once normal crows transmuted by vile essence and viler powers. But one thing all agree on is that ending up a meal for one of these monstrosities is a too-real threat for those who stumble into their deadly lairs.</p><p>Though the deep crow most immediately resembles a massive version of its namesake bird, this creature is a unique form of avian insect. Seen up close, it can easily be discerned from any other giant bird by its insectoid maw, its four-clawed feet, and the cluster of red eyes that are the most unsettling part of its appearance.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1133"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Terror from Above.</span></span> <p>The deep crow's most fearsome attack is the bite of its mandibles, which can seize and h"

Mating is a once-in-a-lifetime urge that sees each deep crow involved in the pairing produce a cluster of four to eight eggs. Incubation lasts a year, followed by a year during which the fledgling deep crows stay close by their parent's side. The young then set out "
