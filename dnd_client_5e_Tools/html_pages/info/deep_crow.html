 b' one of these monstrosities is a too-real threat for those who stumble into '
 b'their deadly lairs.</p><p>Though the deep crow most immediately resembles a '
 b'massive version of its namesake bird, this creature is a unique form of avia'
 b'n insect. Seen up close, it can easily be discerned from any other giant bir'
 b'd by its insectoid maw, its four-clawed feet, and the cluster of red eyes th'
 b'at are the most unsettling part of its appearance.</p><div class="rd__b rd__'

 b"y chance of counterattack. Provided the doomed prey doesn't struggle, the de"
 b'ep crow takes it back to its lair to be devoured at leisure. Creatures that '
