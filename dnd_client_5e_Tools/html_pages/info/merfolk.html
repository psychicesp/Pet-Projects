 b'te under the rule of a single leader. They do so to face a common threat or '
 b'to complete a conquest. Such unifications can be the beginning of undersea k'

 b'water shallow enough that the passage of time can be marked by the gleam and'
 b' fade of sunlight through the water. In the reefs and trenches near their se'
 b'ttlements, merfolk harvest coral and farm the seabed, shepherding schools of'
 b' fish as land-based farmers tend sheep. Only rarely do merfolk venture into '
 b'the darkest depths of the ocean. In such depths and in their undersea cavern'
 b's, merfolk rely on the light of bioluminescent flora and fauna, such as jell'
 b'yfish, whose slow pulsing movements lend merfolk settlements an otherworldly'
