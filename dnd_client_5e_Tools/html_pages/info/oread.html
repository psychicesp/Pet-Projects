 b'mountain crags and near volcanoes, where they caper among the forces of diss'
 b'olution and rebirth. During avalanches and volcanic eruptions, groups of ore'

 b'n the destruction of a novel or remarkable item. In recompense, the oread pr'
 b'ovides the smith with materials drawn from the burning heart of the world, a'
 b'llowing the smith to create an even greater wonder. In more tales, though, a'
