These creatures typically dwell in remote mountain crags and near volcanoes, where they caper among the forces of dissolution and rebirth. During avalanches and volcanic eruptions, groups of oreads might race ahead of the destruction, dancing, singing, and doing what they can to maximize the impending devastation.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5716"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Honor Among Fey.</span></span> <p>Hearkening back to some ages-old conflict, oreads refuse to knowingly destroy any land inhabited by another nymph. While they won't work to alter the natural course of destruction, neither will they make another nymph's home part of any calamity they encourage. As a result, part of what makes an alseid's field or a dryad's grove seem so blessed is that oreads go out of their way to leave such sites alone.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5717"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Tales of Fire.</span></span> <p>The followers of Purphoros regard oreads with special reverence, as myths tell of cagey smiths befriending these nymphs and convincing them to aid in creating phenomenal works. In some tales, a smith finds an oread and allows it to relish in the destruction of a novel or remarkable item. In recompense, the oread provides the smith with materials drawn from the burning heart of the world, allowing the smith to create an even greater wonder. In more tales, though, a smith pursues an oread, then later the mortal's associates find familiar tools and a heap of ashes.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="5718"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Nymphs</span></span> <p>Divine servants that inhabit unspoiled corners of the world, nymphs protect places of natural power and infuse their surroundings with the magic of Nyx. Some are benevolent and aid those who live off the land, while others embody violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sapient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interplay of wild animals, or other cosmic forces. Occasionally, though, groups of the same kind of nymphs congregate in a place of natural power or beauty. In times of special need, deities tied to facets of nature might employ nymphs as messengers, guardians, or scouts.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5719"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Immortal Nature.</span></span> <p>A nymph doesn\'t require food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>')
