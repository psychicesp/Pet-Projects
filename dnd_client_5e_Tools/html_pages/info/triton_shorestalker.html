 b"'t wash away with the tides. When surface dwellers threaten the safety of tr"
 b"iton communities, impede upon Thassa's holiest depths, or steal the treasure"
 b's of the deep, triton shorestalkers seek vengeance. Using speed and poison h'
 b'arvested from deadly sea beasts, these triton assassins slip into shallow wa'
 b"ters and strike when least expected. Often, surface dwellers don't even real"
 b"ize they've been attacked by shorestalkers, chalking disappearances and deat"
 b'hs up to the innumerable dangers of the sea.</p><p>Clever, far-ranging peopl'
 b'e of the sea, tritons live rich lives unknown to most land-dwelling individu'
 b'als. While the waves separate most tritons from land-dwellers, occasionally '
 b'the inhabitants of the surface and the deep come into conflict. In such case'
 b's, tritons prove skilled at sabotaging ocean-going vessels, employing water-'
 b'based magic, and otherwise whipping up the fury of the sea. Few dare insult '
 b'tritons in their home environment, but those who do and survive often learn '
 b"that the tritons' wrath doesn't end at the shore.</p></div></td>")
