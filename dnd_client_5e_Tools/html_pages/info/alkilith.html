These dripping infestations conceal the demonic nature of the alkilith, making what should be a dire warning appear strange but otherwise innocuous. Wherever alkiliths take root, they weaken the fabric of reality, creating a portal through which even nastier demons can invade.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="388"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Symptoms of Doom.</span></span> <p>The appearance of an alkilith in the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such as a window or a door around which it can take root, stretching its body around the opening and anchoring itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually becomes a portal to that plane (see <a href="book.html#DMG,2,planar%20portals,0">"Planar Portals"</a> in chapter 2 of the <a href="book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="389"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Spawn of Juiblex.</span></span> <p>Alkiliths spring from the cast-off bits of Juiblex's hideous, shuddering body, then gradually become self-aware and set out to find their way onto the Material Plane. Since most cultists consider them too risky for summoning—they can, after all, create portals to the Abyss—alkiliths must find other escape routes out of their native plane.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></div></td>
