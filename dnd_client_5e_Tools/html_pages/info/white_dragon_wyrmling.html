 b' The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon age'
 b's, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by t'
 b'he time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. Thi'

 b'ns. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all drag'
 b'onkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A wh'
 b'ite dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures kill'
 b'ed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases ot'
 b'her kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a la'
 b'rder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p><div class="'

 b'<p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memo'
 b'ries. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct ma'
 b'licious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often incl'
 b'udes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dra'
 b'gons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do s'

 b"can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks oth"
 b'er creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak '
 b'or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dra'
 b'gon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage th'
 b"e dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result "
 b'of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly f'
 b'ound in their lairs.</p><p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dra'
 b"gon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost "
 b'giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their'
 b" status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's"
 b' lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its s'
 b'ervant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserti'
 b'ng its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the gian'
 b't.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-ti'
