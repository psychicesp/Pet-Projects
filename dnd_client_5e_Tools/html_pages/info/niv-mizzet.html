From his private laboratory at the top of the Izzet guildhall, Niv-Mizzet directs the research and experiments of his countless underlings. He coordinates a tremendous number of apparently unrelated projects, working toward some mysterious end.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>There can be little doubt that this ancient dragon is one of the most intelligent beings on Ravnica and one of the world's most powerful spellcasters. He is just as acquisitive as any dragon, but his treasure is scientific and magical knowledge. His ambition is a looming threat in the minds of all the other guildmasters, but confronting him directly is almost unthinkable thanks to the combination of his awesome magical power and the sheer physical threat of a fire-breathing, swordtoothed dragon.</p></div></div></div></td>')
