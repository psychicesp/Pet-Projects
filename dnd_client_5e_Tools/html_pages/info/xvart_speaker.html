 b">Raxivort's Betrayal.</span></span> <p> All xvarts are the degenerate offspr"
 b"ing of an entity named Raxivort, who once served Graz'zt the Dark Prince as "
 b'treasurer. Raxivort spent long centuries watching over the treasury, and in '
 b"time he grew to lust after his master's riches. In one bold move, he plunder"
 b'ed a treasure vault and fled to the Material Plane. One of the treasures he '
 b'stole was the Infinity Spindle, a crystalline shard from the early days of t'
 b'he multiverse that could transform even a creature as low as Raxivort into a'
 b' demigod.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>After he ascended to '
 b'godhood, Raxivort forged a realm called the Black Sewers, within Pandesmos, '
 b'the topmost layer of Pandemonium. He enjoyed his divine ascension only brief'
 b"ly, though, before Graz'zt unleashed his vengeance. The demon prince had no "
 b'need to regain the Infinity Spindle, since he already possessed power greate'
 b'r than what it could grant. Instead, he dispatched agents far and wide to sp'
 b'read news of what the spindle could do and the puny, pathetic creature that '
 b'claimed its ownership. Soon enough, Raxivort was pursued by a variety of ene'
 b'mies, all eager to claim the Spindle as their own.</p><p>In the face of his '
 b'imminent destruction, Raxivort hatched a plan. Fleeing to the Material Plane'
 b', he wandered across a variety of worlds and spawned creatures that were his'
 b' exact duplicate. These are the xvarts, creatures that not only look identic'
 b'al to Raxivort in appearance but also foil any magic used to track him down.'
 b" Spells, rituals, and other effects that could reveal Raxivort's location in"
 b'stead point to the nearest xvart.</p><p>Although the initial rush of enemies'
 b' against him has subsided, Raxivort knows that the planar powers are patient'
 b'. He remains in hiding, a wretch of a demigod who does little more than wand'
 b'er the planes, spawning ever more xvarts to ensure his continued safety.</p>'

 b"them to their craven god. Hmm. I guess they're not so different from a lot o"
 b'f humans, after all.</p><p>-Volo</p><p>Despite their muddled nature, all xva'
 b'rts have an unshakable devotion to Raxivort. The desire to please Raxivort w'
 b"eighs heavily on all their decisions. When things aren't going well for them"
 b', xvarts naturally assume that Raxivort is angry. To appease their troubled '
 b'lord, they stage kidnappings. They fashion nets to capture their enemies, wh'
 b'ich are dragged back to the lair and sacrificed on a makeshift altar. Raxivo'
 b"rt can hear their supplications, but he's too afraid to come out of hiding m"
 b'ost of the time. Occasionally, he does appear before a tribe of worshipers a'
 b's a 9-foot-tall xvart carrying an empty sack. In every such instance, Raxivo'
 b'rt takes all of the treasure that the tribe has accumulated, stuffs it in hi'
 b's sack, and disappears, leaving nothing behind as compensation.</p><p>Xvart '

 b'lination to do so. They are greedy, conniving, and obsessed with the acquisi'

 b'al to act on their hatred most of the time. Their fear has led them to dwell'
 b' either in gloomy places on the far fringes of civilized lands or in areas n'
 b'eglected or forgotten by mightier creatures. In other words, xvarts usually '
