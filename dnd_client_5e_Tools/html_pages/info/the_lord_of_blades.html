 b'destruction on their former masters.</p><p>Some tales assert that the Lord o'
 b'f Blades led the warforged armies of Cyre in the Last War. Others cast him a'
 b's a newer warforged, perhaps the last to come out of the Cannith creation fo'
 b'rges before the Thronehold Accords led to their dismantling. One story claim'
 b's the Lord of Blades caused the destruction of Cyre and warns that he plans '
 b'to repeat the Day of Mourning in each of the remaining Five Nations. Whateve'
 b'r the truth, he has become a beacon for warforged everywhere.</p><div class='
