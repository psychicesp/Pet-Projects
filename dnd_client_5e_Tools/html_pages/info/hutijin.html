 b'litics in the Nine Hells are anything but predictable. Alliances form all th'
 b'e time, but most wind up unraveling due to treachery. Nevertheless, for all '
 b'their backbiting and betrayal, the devils do occasionally display loyalty, o'
 b'ffering unwavering service to their masters. One such example is Hutijin, a '
 b'duke of Cania and loyal servant of Mephistopheles.</p><div class="rd__spc-in'
 b'line-post"></div><p>Across the Hells, Hutijin\'s name fills lesser devils'
 b' with fear and loathing, for this duke commands two companies of pit fiends,'
 b" which make up Cania's aristocracy. With such soldiers under his command, Hu"
 b'tijin can easily crush any rival who gets in his way, while also providing M'
 b'ephistopheles with security against armies that might seek to contest his do'
 b'minion. Hutijin has amassed enough power to challenge the lord of Cania, but'
 b' he has never wavered in his support for his master\xe2\x80\x94suggesting'
 b', perhaps, that Mephistopheles has some hold over him.</p><p>Outside the Nin'
 b'e Hells, Hutijin is a relatively obscure figure, known only to the most lear'
 b'ned infernal scholars. He has no cults of his own, and his servants are few '
 b'in number. The reason is simple: Hutijin hates mortals. When summoned from t'
 b'he Hells, he repays the instigator with a long and agonizing death.</p><p>Me'
 b'phistopheles forbids Hutijin from making too many forays into the Material P'
 b"lane, since the duke's absence leaves him vulnerable to his rivals. Other ar"
 b'chdevils know how much Hutijin despises mortals and have secretly disseminat'
 b'ed the means to call him from the Nine Hells in the hope of distracting the '
 b'archdevil long enough for them to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devil'
 b's into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of his name and destroy those'
 b' who have learned of him, but the summonings still occur. When called from h'
 b'is post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing a deal with lit'
 b'tle cost to the summoner. However, once the deal has been struck, Hutijin re'
 b'pays the interruption with death.</p></div></div></div></td>')
