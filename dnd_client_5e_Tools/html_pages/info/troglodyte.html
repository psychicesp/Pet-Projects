Too simple to plan more than a few days into the future, troglodytes rely on constant raids and hunting to survive. They take sadistic pleasure in hunting intelligent creatures weaker than themselves and show no mercy toward those they capture and drag back to their lairs to be devoured. The largest and toughest troglodytes lead the hunt and become the leaders of their tribes. However, if a leader shows any weakness or hesitation, other troglodytes attack and eat it in a frenzy.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Troglodytes make little and build less, scavenging their possessions from their prey. They understand the value of metal weapons and armor, and fight among one another for the right to have such items. A troglodyte tribe might be torn apart by battles over a single longsword.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7893"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Devotees of Laogzed.</span></span> <p>Some troglodytes venerate Laogzed, a demonic, monstrously fat toad-lizard that slumbers in the Abyss.
