 b'ent living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. '
 b'Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce i'
 b'nto a manifest form and create a genie.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post">'
 b'</div><p>A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form'
 b". That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and a"
 b'pparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they '
 b'resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. '
 b"They don't mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new gen"
 b'ies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elementa'
 b'l power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose '
 b'to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.</p><p>When '
 b'a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or car'
 b'rying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gus'
 b't of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.</p><p>In'
 b' contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service'
 b' themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled'
 b' by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare '
 b'few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal m'
 b'ages often seek to bind genies into service.</p><p>Noble genies cultivate th'
 b'e jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every op'
 b'portunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing h'
 b'ow unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie'
 b" isn't beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to de"
 b"fy a noble genie's will and risk the consequences.</p><p>Their miraculous po"
 b'wers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow so'
 b'me genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the g'
 b'ods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole con'
 b'tinents or worlds-bow down before them.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"'

 b'ing property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own '
