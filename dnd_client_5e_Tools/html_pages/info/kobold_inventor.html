 b'two attacks before they break, but might be surprisingly effective in the me'
 b"antime. Most inventors are skilled enough that their improvised weapons don'"
 b"t backfire on them, but other users might not be so lucky. The weapons don't"

 b'res, or confuses a creature long enough for other kobolds to kill the enemy.'
