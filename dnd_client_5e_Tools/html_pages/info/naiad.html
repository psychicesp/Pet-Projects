 b'en grow fixated with a single type or body of water, potentially preferring '
 b'a deep sea trench, coastline, or river system above all others. Over time, s'
 b'uch a resident nymph often becomes connected with their aquatic home through'

 b'enageries. The occasional star-crossed castaway has even been known to becom'

 b'ies, a ship might reach any destination in record time, be it across the sea'
 b' or along a river a hundred miles inland. Naiads do nothing to dissuade sail'
 b'ors from this belief, and certainly numerous reports tell of charmed nymphs '
