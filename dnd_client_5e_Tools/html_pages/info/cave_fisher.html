 b've fisher usually hunts small animals and is fond of bats, so it stretches i'
 b'ts filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then cli'
 b'mbs to a hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. Whe'
 b'n prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A grou'
 b'p of cave fishers might work together to cover a large area with filaments, '
 b'but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area co'
 b'mpetes for the prize. If a victim escapes from the initial ambush, a cave fi'
 b'sher can reclaim its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again.</p'

 b' that larger targets such as humanoids are more difficult to overcome, so th'
 b'e creatures shy away from attacking such prey unless they come across a soli'
 b'tary target. They might try to pick off a scout moving ahead of a group of t'
 b'ravelers or a straggler lagging behind, rather than attracting the attention'
 b' of the entire group.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__'

 b'ven into rope that is thin, tough, and nearly invisible. Cave fisher meat is'
