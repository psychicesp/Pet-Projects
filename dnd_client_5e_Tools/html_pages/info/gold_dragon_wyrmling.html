 b'True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They'
 b' are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest'

 b'ons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath'

 b'wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall '
 b'into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, '

 b' dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to '
 b'ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, the'
