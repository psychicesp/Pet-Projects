 b'eans of the world. In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent th'
 b'e minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bou'
 b'nd to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants.'
 b' Therefore, they created chuuls.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><'
 b'p>Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at t'
 b"he aboleths' command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, "
 b"growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths' empire c"
 b'rumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, the'
 b'se creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collectin'
 b'g humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.</p'
