 b"usculature aren't yet strong enough to allow the wormling to burrow through "
 b'rock. The poison in its tail stinger and the acid in its gullet are still re'
 b'latively weak as well. Nevertheless, the wormling is a voracious feeder and '
 b"attacks just about anything it can wrap its mouth around. A wormling's gulle"
