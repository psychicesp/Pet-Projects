 b'bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. These omnivo'
 b'res have a diet that consists of berries, nuts, flowers, and small animals s'
 b'uch as insects, mice, and frogs-things they can swallow whole. They would be'
 b' no threat to anything else if not for their fierce and frenzied response to'
 b' even a hint of danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squa'
 b'wking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smalles'
 b"t scratch from a cockatrice's beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns"
 b' to stone from the injury.</p></div></div></td>')
