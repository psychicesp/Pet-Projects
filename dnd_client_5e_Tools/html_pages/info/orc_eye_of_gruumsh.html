 b's and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathere'
 b'd to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mounta'
 b'ins, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the for'
 b'ests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wante'
 b'd had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he respon'
 b'ded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the m'
 b'ountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Su'
 b'ch was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the'
 b' other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on h'
 b'umans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"><'

 b"thian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Si"
 b'nce then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning '
 b'his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion '
 b'who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p><div class="rd__b '

 b'ather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by pl'
 b'undering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any h'

 b'ribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p>'

 b'efensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across t'
 b'he countryside to sate their appetites.</p><p>Strength and power are the gre'
 b'atest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in '
 b'their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres'

 b'ear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and so'
 b'ldiers.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h-'

 b"es swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stro"
 b'nger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other ra'
 b'ces. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stat'
