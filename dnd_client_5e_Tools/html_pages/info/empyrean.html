 b' <p>An empyrean can experience deity-like fits of serenity or rage. It can a'
 b'ffect the environment around it by its mood. When an empyrean is unhappy, th'
 b'e clouds might cry tears of salt water, the wildflowers in surrounding meado'
 b'ws might wilt, dead fish might wash ashore in lakes or rivers, or a nearby f'
 b'orest might lose the leaves from its trees. When an empyrean is jubilant, su'
 b'nlight follows it everywhere, small animals frolic in its footsteps, and bir'
 b'ds fill the sky with their pleasing songs.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-pos'

 b'ally retreats to the Material Plane, where it can rule over a kingdom of mor'
