They take contracts to put down uprisings, clear out rabble, and eliminate scouts and skirmishers, and they revel in the butchery they create, their unhinged laughter rising above their victims\' screams.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Since dhergoloths are little more than dumb brutes, employers must use caution when instructing these fiends. They can handle simple orders that don't take a lot of time to resolve. When given anything complex to do, they either forget what they're told or don't listen in the first place, and then bungle the task that was set for them.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1251"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Yugoloths.</span></span> <p>Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for ever more wealth.

Yugoloths come in a wide variety of forms, including those described in the <a href="bestiary.html#blankhash,flstsource:mm=1,flsttag:yugoloth=1">Monster Manual</a> and the six creatures presented <a href="bestiary.html#blankhash,flstsource:mtf=1,flsttag:yugoloth=1">here</a>.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
