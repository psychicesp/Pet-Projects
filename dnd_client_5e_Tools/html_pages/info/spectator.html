 b'Though it can speak, a spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy.'
 b' It is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and its summoner. '
 b'However, even a brief conversation with a spectator is enough to reveal quir'
 b'ks in its personality brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent '
 b'imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or try to adopt the '
 b'voice of its summoner.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Like any'
 b' beholder, a spectator views itself as the epitome of its kind, and it has a'
 b'n intense hatred of other spectators. If two spectators encounter one anothe'
