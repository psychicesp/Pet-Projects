If a creature opts not to attack, though, the Angry becomes confused, and its attacks weaken. Each of the Angry has two heads, which bicker with each other until they find something else on which they can vent their wrath.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7642"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Sorrowsworn.</span></span> <p>The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7643"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Emotion Given Form.</span></span> <p>Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
