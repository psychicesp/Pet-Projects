 b'ound anywhere dragons are known to dwell, and those that live in the mountai'

 b' as best they can to the hostile climate. Their sensitive eyes appreciate su'
 b'nless days and long, dark nights. They use wooden javelins as tools to test '

 b'er into Ten-Towns to escape the dreadful cold, hoping to trade what few skil'
 b'ls they have for some warm soup and shelter. The people of Ten-Towns, accust'
 b'omed to the presence of strange outlanders, allow these kobolds to dwell amo'
 b"ng them for the most part. When the kobolds don't feel safe, they acquire he"
 b'avy winter clothing and disguise themselves as humans by standing on one ano'
