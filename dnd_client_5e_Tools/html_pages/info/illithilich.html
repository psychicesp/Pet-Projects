 b'ains forbid mind flayers from pursuing magic power aside from psionics, but '
 b"it isn't an interdiction they must often enforce. Illithids brook no masters"
 b" but members of their own kind, so it isn't in their nature to bow to any go"
 b'd or otherworldly patron. However, wizardry remains a rare temptation.</p><d'
 b'iv class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>In the pages of a spellbook, an illi'
 b'thid sees a system to acquire authority. Through the writings of the wizard '
 b'who penned it, the illithid perceives the workings of a highly intelligent m'
 b'ind. Most mind flayers who find a spellbook react with abhorrence or indiffe'
 b'rence, but for some a spellbook is a gateway to a new way of thinking.</p><p'
 b'>For a time, the study of such forbidden texts can be hidden from other illi'
 b'thids and even from an elder brain. Understanding of wizardry eludes the min'
 b'd like a living thing. Yet eventually, understanding comes, and a mind flaye'
 b'r arcanist must accept itself as deviant and flee the colony if it is to liv'
 b'e.</p><p>Confronting this awful reality, a group of nine mind flayer deviant'
 b's used their arcane magic and psionics to weave a new truth. These nine call'
 b'ed themselves the alhoon, and ever afterward, all those who follow in their '
 b'footsteps have been referred to by the same name.</p><p>Initially, an alhoon'
 b' can be difficult to distinguish from a normal mind flayer. The most obvious'
 b" difference is the lack of the mind flayer's ever-present mucus coating. Wit"
 b"hout that protection, an alhoon's skin becomes dry and cracked. Its eyes mig"
 b'ht appear shriveled and sunken. Both of these clues are easily missed by som'
 b"eone who hasn't seen a mind flayer. However, in short order, an alhoon's fle"
 b'sh withers away and its empty eye sockets gleam with cold pinpricks of light'
 b' like other liches.</p><p>The undeath conferred by a periapt of mind trappin'
 b'g lasts only so long as the life of the living victim selected. Thus an alho'
 b'on who brought a 200-year-old elf to be sacrificed looks forward to a much l'
 b'onger existence than one that sacrifices a 35-year-old person. Alhoons can e'
 b'xtend their existence by repeating the ritual with new victims, effectively '
 b'resetting the clocks for themselves.</p><p>Destruction of a periapt of mind '
 b'trapping consigns those trapped within it to oblivion, and thus alhoons ofte'
 b'n work together to create elaborate protections about the periapt and their '
 b'preferred ritual site. Sometimes a single alhoon is entrusted with the peria'
 b'pt of mind trapping, but this is a dangerous proposition. Anyone who holds t'
 b'he periapt of mind trapping gains advantage on attacks, saves, and check aga'
 b'inst the alhoons associated with its creation, and those alhoons in turn suf'
 b'fer disadvantage on attacks, saves, and check against the holder.</p><p>In a'
 b'ddition, the holder of the periapt can telepathically communicate with any s'
 b'acrificed soul trapped within, and alhoons within the periapt can speak tele'
 b"pathically with the holder. A creature carrying the periapt can't prevent co"
 b'mmunication from alhoons but can silence trapped souls.</p></div><div class='
