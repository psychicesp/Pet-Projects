 b'sters of any sort among the goblins are rare. Goblins typically lack the int'
 b'elligence and patience needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare '
 b'poorly even when given access to the necessary training and knowledge. Sorce'
 b'rers are less prevalent among them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaey'
 b'ag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his followers. And althoug'
 b'h many goblins would readily offer anything to have the abilities of a warlo'

 b'use they have so little experience with magic, goblins make no distinction b'
 b'etween its forms. To them all magic is "booyahg," and the word is part of th'
 b'e name they give to any of its practitioners.</p><p>A goblin with access to '
