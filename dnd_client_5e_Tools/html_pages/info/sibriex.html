 b'Sibriexes have spent eons amassing information from across the planes, hoard'
 b'ing knowledge for when it might be useful. Such is their incredible intellec'
 b't that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advi'
 b'sors and oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, while other s'
 b'ibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out lore only when doing so would'
 b' advance their plans.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div c'

 b'>Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from othe'
 b'r creatures. Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers of rutter'
 b'kins to protect their lands and to ensure that the plane teems with destruct'
 b'ive monsters. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they'
 b' are moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demon'
 b's greater strength, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely; the'
 b'y demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provid'
 b'e.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td>')
