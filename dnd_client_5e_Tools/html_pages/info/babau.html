One of these battles pitted the legions of the archdevil Glasya against the screaming hordes of the demon lord Graz'zt. It is said that Glasya wounded Graz'zt with her sword, and the first babaus arose where his blood struck the ground. Their sudden appearance helped rout Glasya and secured Graz'zt's place as one of the preeminent demon lords of the Abyss.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A babau demon possesses the cunning of a devil and the bloodthirstiness of a demon.
