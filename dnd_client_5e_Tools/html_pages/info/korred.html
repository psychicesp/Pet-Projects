 b'doors that lead through stone are as obvious as windows to a korred.</p><div'

 b'their bodies, but the hair that grows from their heads is magical. When cut,'

 b'hears to cut lengths of their hair, then weave the strands together to creat'
 b'e iron ropes that they can manipulate, animating them to bind or snake aroun'
 b'd creatures and objects. Korreds take great pride in their hair, and equally'
