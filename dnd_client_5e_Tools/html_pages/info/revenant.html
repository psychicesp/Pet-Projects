 b"ially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's ey"
 b'es burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the reve'
 b"nant's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit o"
 b'f the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the re'
 b'venant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for wh'
