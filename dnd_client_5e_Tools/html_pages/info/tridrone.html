 b'orked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which each modron receives commands from s'
 b'uperiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron carries out commands w'
 b'ith total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of morality or ego. M'
 b'odrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to fulfill their dutie'
 b's. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet they always ref'
 b'er to themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no "I," but only "we" o'
