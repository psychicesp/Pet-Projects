 b'domination, an elder brain sprawls within a vat of viscous brine, touching t'

 b'sychic Infiltrators.</span></span> <p> When an elder brain infiltrates a min'
 b"d, it alters the creature's perception and deceives its senses, causing it t"
 b"o see, hear, touch, taste, or feel reality according to the elder brain's in"
 b'tent. From across great distances, it implants subconscious suggestions or s'
 b'ubtly influences dreams to compel creatures toward a course of action that b'
 b'enefits its grand plan.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>When it'
 b's insidious suggestions fail to take hold, an elder brain asserts its domina'
 b'nce more directly. It seizes control of a resistant mind and controls the cr'
 b"eature's body as it would a puppet. Against the rare, strong-willed stalwart"
 b' that defies it or attacks it, an elder brain sends a blast of overwhelming '
 b"psychic force to crush the upstart's mind, rendering the creature a thoughtl"
 b"ess, drooling shell.</p><p>When a mind flayer perishes, the elder brain's se"
 b'rvants feed the contents of its skull to their master, which absorbs the ill'
 b"ithid's brain and all the knowledge and experience contained therein. In thi"
 b's way the elder brain continually increases its knowledge, uniting the thoug'
 b'hts and experiences of the illithid colony into a unified whole. Mind flayer'
 b's conceive of this "oneness" as a sacred state in the same way that a worshi'
 b'per of a human deity might view an eternal afterlife in the heavens-for an e'
 b'lder brain can evoke the persona of any illithid it has ever absorbed.</p><p'
 b'>The ambitions of an elder brain are always tempered by its relative immobil'
 b'ity. Although its telepathic senses can reach for miles, moving anywhere is '
 b'always a dangerous proposition. If forced outside its brine pool, an elder b'
 b'rain will swiftly expire, and transporting an elder brain in its pool throug'
 b'h confining and tortuous subterranean tunnels frequently proves difficult or'
 b' impossible.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--'
