A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7110"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Dwellers in Darkness.</span></span> <p> Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them.
