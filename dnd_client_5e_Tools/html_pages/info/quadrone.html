 b'er the direction of their leader, Primus, modrons increase order in the mult'

 b'ir own minds are networked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which each modron rec'
 b'eives commands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron c'
 b'arries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence '
 b'of morality or ego. Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary t'
 b'o fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks'
