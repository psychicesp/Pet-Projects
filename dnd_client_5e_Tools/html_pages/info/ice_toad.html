 b'k only their own obscure language. Those in Oyaviggaton know a little Dracon'
 b'ic and Uluik (the language of the Ice Hunters), but their accents are thick '

 b'any hours spent conversing with Arauthator.</p><p>When the characters encoun'

 b'surprisingly dexterous. Some carry tools and useful items in pouches slung a'
 b'round their necks.</p></div></div></div></td>')
