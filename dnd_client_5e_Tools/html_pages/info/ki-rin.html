 b'es. In the Outer Planes, ki-rins in service to benevolent deities take a dir'
 b'ect role in the eternal struggle between good and evil. In the mortal world,'
 b' a ki-rin is celebrated far and wide as a harbinger of destiny, a guardian o'
 b'f the sacred, and a counterbalance to the forces of evil.</p><div class="rd_'

 b'mply beholding one can evoke fear or awe in an observer. A typical ki-rin lo'
 b'oks like a muscular stag the size of an elephant, covered in golden scales l'
 b'ined in some places with golden fur. It has a dark gold mane and tail, coppe'
 b'ry cloven hooves, and a spiral-shaped coppery horn just above and between it'
 b"s luminous violet eyes. In a breeze or when aloft, the creature's scales and"
 b' hair can create the impression that the ki-rin is ablaze with a holy, golde'
 b'n fire.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Beyond their coloration'
 b', ki-rins vary in appearance, based on the deity each one reveres and the fu'
 b'nction it typically performs in service to that god. Some are horse-shaped, '
 b'looking like gigantic unicorns, and are often used as guardians. Others have'
 b' draconic features and tend to be aggressive foes of evil. One horn is most '
 b'common, but a ki-rin of fierce demeanor might have two horns or a set of ant'
 b'lers like those of a great stag.</p><p>A ki-rin in the world claims a territ'
 b'ory to watch over, and one ki-rin might safeguard an area that encompasses s'
 b'everal nations. On other planes, ki-rins that serve good deities go wherever'
 b' they are commanded, which could include coming to the Material Plane on a m'
 b'ission. A ki-rin disciple in the world usually serves its deity as a scout, '
 b'a messenger, or a spy.</p><p>Ki-rins are attracted to the worship of deities'
 b' of courage, loyalty, selflessness, and truth, as well as the advancement of'
 b' just societies. For instance, in Faer\xc3\xbbn, ki-rins rally mostly to T'
 b'orm, although ki-rins also serve his allies Tyr and Ilmater.</p><p>Many who '
 b"seek a ki-rin's guidance end up pledging service to the creature. They study"
 b' as monks under its tutelage and serve as its agents in the world. The follo'
 b'wers of a ki-rin might travel incognito across the land, seeking news of gro'
 b'wing evil and working behind the scenes, or might be champions of their mast'
 b"er's cause, out to defeat villainy wherever it is found.</p></div><div class"

 b' Common folk consider ki-rins to be rare and remote heralds of good fortune.'
 b' Seeing a ki-rin fly overhead is a blessing, and events that happen on such '
 b'a day are especially auspicious. If a ki-rin alights during a ceremony, such'
 b' as a birth announcement or a coronation, everyone present understands that '
 b'the creature is telling them great good could be in the offing. The ki-rin c'
 b'onveys its gifts and omens, then rises back into the sky. Ki-rins have also '
 b'been known to appear at the sites of great battles to inspire and strengthen'
 b' the side of good, or to rescue heroes from certain death.</p><div class="rd'

 b'r its wisdom, other creatures would naturally seek it out with questions and'
