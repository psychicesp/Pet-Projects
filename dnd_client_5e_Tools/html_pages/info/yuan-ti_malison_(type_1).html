They lauded the serpent's sinuous flexibility, i"
 b'ts calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Yuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.</p><p>Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can't be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse"

They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.</p><p>Yuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses.

Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="9187"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Cold of Heart.</span></span> <p> Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an exploitable weakness.
