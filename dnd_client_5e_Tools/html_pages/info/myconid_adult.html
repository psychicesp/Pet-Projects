The myconids' rapport spores bind the participants into a group consciousness. Hallucination spores then induce a shared dream that provides entertainment and social interaction. Myconids consider melding to be the purpose of their existence. They use it in the pursuit of higher consciousness, collective union, and spiritual apotheosis. Myconids also use their rapport spores to communicate telepathically with other sentient creatures.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="5217"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Myconid Reproduction.</span></span> <p>Like other fungi, myconids reproduce by mundane sporing.
