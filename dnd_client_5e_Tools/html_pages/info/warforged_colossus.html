These enormous mechanical warriors thundered across Cyre, crushing everything in their paths and leaving ruin behind them. Meant to end the war decisively, the colossi pulverized hundreds of soldiers beneath their feet and incinerated whole legions with beams of fiery light that shot from their mouths. This rampage was cut short on the Day of Mourning. The arcane cataclysm that engulfed Cyre destroyed most of the warforged colossi, causing them to collapse into lifeless heaps.</p><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="8402"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Colossal Survivors.</span></span> <p>Some warforged colossi survived the Day of Mourning more or less intact and are thought to only be in stasis, waiting to be awakened.
