 b'o shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills'

 b'an> <p>A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures t'
 b'hroughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladl'
 b'y share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a b'
 b"rass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows "
 b'it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might r'
 b'espond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature'
 b'. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant cla'
 b"ws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small "
 b'talk is slaked.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A brass dragon '
 b'is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it doe'
 b's, but is smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happe'

 b' a game.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" d'

 b'Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places '
 b'far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their t'
 b'reasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wand'
 b'erers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a t'
 b'reasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be p'
 b'arts of a brass dragon\'s hoard.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><sp'
