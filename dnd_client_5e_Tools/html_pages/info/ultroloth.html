 b'ht hags on Gehenna. It is widely believed that Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine He'
 b'lls, commissioned the work, in the hope of creating an army of fiends that w'
 b'ere not bound to the Nine Hells. In the course of making this new army, the '
 b'hags crafted four magic tomes and recorded the true names of every yugoloth '
 b'they created, save one, the General of Gehenna. These tomes were called the '
 b"Books of Keeping. Since knowing a fiend's true name grants power over it, th"
 b"e hags used the books to ensure the yugoloths' loyalty. They also used the b"
 b'ooks to capture the true names of other fiends that crossed them. It is rumo'
 b'red that the Books of Keeping contain the true names of a few demon lords an'
 b'd archdevils as well.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Petty jea'
 b'lousies and endless bickering caused the sisterhood to dissolve, and in the '
 b'ensuing power grab, the Books of Keeping were lost or stolen. No longer inde'
 b'ntured to anyone, the yugoloths gained independence, and they now offer thei'
 b'r services to the highest bidder.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span'

 b"d anywhere, but the high cost of maintaining a yugoloth army's loyalty typic"
 b'ally exceeds what any warlord on the Material Plane can pay. Being self-serv'
 b'ing creatures, yugoloths quarrel among themselves constantly. A yugoloth arm'
 b'y is more organized than a ravening horde of demons, but far less orderly an'
 b'd regimented than a legion of devils. Without a powerful leader to keep them'
 b' in line, yugoloths fight simply to indulge their violent predilections, and'
 b' only as long as it benefits them to do so.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b'
