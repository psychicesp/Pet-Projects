 b'p> Quicklings owe their existence-and their plight-to the Queen of Air and D'
 b'arkness, the dread ruler of the Gloaming Court. Once a race of lazy and egot'
 b'istical fey, the creatures that would become the quicklings were late in ans'
 b"wering the queen's summons one time too many. To hasten their pace and teach"
 b' them to mind her will, the queen shrank their stature and sped up their int'
 b"ernal clocks. The queen's curse gave quicklings their amazing speed but also"
 b' accelerated their passage through life-no quickling lives longer than fifte'
 b'en years.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>To other creatures, a'
 b' quickling seems blindingly fast, vanishing into an indistinct blur as it mo'
 b'ves. Its cruel laughter is a burst of rapid staccato sounds, its speech a sh'
 b'rill squeal. Only when a quickling deliberately slows down, which it prefers'
 b' not to do, can other beings properly see, hear, and comprehend it. Never tr'
 b'uly at rest, a "stationary" quickling constantly paces and shifts in place, '
 b"as though it can't wait to be off again.</p><p>Tricks of that sort are hardl"
 b"y the limit of their artful malice, however. They don't commit outright murd"
 b'er, but quicklings can ruin lives in plenty of other ways: stealing an impor'
 b'tant letter, swiping coins collected for the poor, planting a stolen item in'
 b" someone's bag. Quicklings enjoy causing suffering that transcends mere mis "
 b'chief, especially when the blame for their actions falls on other creatures '
 b'and creates discord.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h'

 b"ace to a quickling's eye: a hurricane creeps gradually across the sky, a tor"

 b'andering path from cloud to cloud. The slow and boring world seems to be pop'
 b'ulated by torpid creatures whose deep, mooing speech lacks meaning.</p><div '

 b'icious nature that goes well with their energy level: they think as fast as '

 b's time perpetrating acts of mischief on slower creatures. One rarely passes '
 b"up an opportunity to tie a person's bootlaces together, move the stool a cre"
 b"ature is about to sit on, or unbuckle a saddle while no one's looking.</p><d"
