They plumb the depths of their powerful connection to the elements and disperse themselves into nature, literally transforming into semiconscious storms. The blizzard that rages unendingly around a mountain peak, the vortex that swirls around a remote island, or the thunderstorm that howls ceaselessly up and down a rugged coastline could, in fact, be the undying form of a storm giant clinging to existence.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="7412"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Elemental Weapons.</span></span> <p> A storm giant quintessent sheds its armor and weapons, but gains the power to form makeshift weapons out of thin air.

Its lair is usually a secluded region or prominent geographic feature, such as a mountain peak, a great waterfall, a remote island, a fog-shrouded loch, a beautiful coral reef, or a windswept desert bluff. As befits the environment, the storm in which the giant lives could be a blizzard, a typhoon, a thunderstorm, or a sandstorm.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="7415"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lair Actions</span></span> <p>A storm giant quintessent can use lair actions in giant form and while transformed into a storm.

The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured.
