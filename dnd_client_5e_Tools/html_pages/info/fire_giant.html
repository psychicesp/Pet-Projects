 b's-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants-are related by commo'
 b'n elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindr'
 b'ed, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.'
 b'</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on socia'
 b'l class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each gian'
 b't. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other gian'
 b'ts are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of th'
 b'e giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to det'
 b'ermine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of '
 b'their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the gia'
 b'nts are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the'
 b' ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants,'
 b' hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p'
 b"><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill gia"
 b'nt tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked g'
 b'iant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type'
 b". It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another t"
 b'ype, merely rude.</p></div><div class="rd__b-inset"><span class="rd__h rd__h'

 b'l giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon ei'
 b'ther again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their '
 b'birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but'
 b' to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villain'
 b"s that make up the giants' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods are the ch"
 b'ildren of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for stor'
 b'm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thr'
 b'ym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. '
 b"Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Man"
 b'y good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm gian'
 b't dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym '
 b"than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters"
 b', who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of lov'
 b'e and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</p><p>Some'

 b'o Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a'
 b' great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcas'
