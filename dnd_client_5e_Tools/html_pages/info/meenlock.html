At night, they crawl out of their tunnels to torment sleeping prey, particularly those who seem to embody all that is good in the world. Meenlocks like to paralyze creatures with their claws, drag them back to their hidden den, beat them unconscious, and telepathically torture them over a period of hours. A humanoid that succumbs to this psychic torment undergoes a transformation into an evil, full-grown meenlock (see the "Telepathic Torment" sidebar).</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4926"> <span class="entry-title-inner help-subtle">Dark Dwellers.</span></span> <p> A meenlock shuns bright light.
