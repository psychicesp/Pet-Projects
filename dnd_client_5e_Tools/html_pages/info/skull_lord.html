 b'heir dominion. From these blighted lands, they wage war against their rivals'

 b"from this turn of events, Vecna's warlords turned against each other, and th"
 b"e dark one's plans were dashed. In a rage, Vecna gathered up his generals an"
 b'd captains and bound them in groups of three, fusing them into undead abomin'
 b'ations cursed to fight among themselves for all time. Since the first skull '
