 b'ics of an orc. It never bathes if it can help it, and its thick skin is usua'
 b'lly encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime beneath the stinking hide'
 b's it wears. Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess about its faces, '
 b'and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked teeth and tusks.</p><di'

 b'n> <p>The twin heads of an ettin are two individuals trapped in the same bru'
 b'tish body. Each head has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses '
 b'unique preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely expe'
 b'rience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an ettin b'
 b'ullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each taking constant'
 b' offense at the other\'s slights.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></d'
 b'iv><p>When other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names '
 b'to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole. If a'
 b'n ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other creatures '
 b'call the ettin Harglevargle.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span clas'

 b' itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a conversation betw'
 b'een two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting match between a crowd of '
 b'four belligerent heads. Most ettins are solitary creatures as a result, tole'
 b'rating one another only to reproduce.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></'
 b"div><p>An ettin's twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to matc"

 b" ettins' mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin hunts "
 b'and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her six-month preg'
 b'nancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released from servitude. Wh'
 b'en the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and '
 b'abandons the den.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd'

 b'>Two Heads are Better than One.</span></span> <p>When focused on a mutually '
 b'beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its pe'
 b'rsonality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights w'
 b'ith a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective he'
 b'ads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its '
 b'only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that dist'
 b'urbs its precious solitude.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div>'

 b' <p>In ancient dialects of Common, the word "ettin" translates as "ugly gian'
 b't." Legends tell of orcs that once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the'
 b' magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Pri'
 b'nce of Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the wi'
 b'lderness to become the first ettins.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></d'
 b"iv><p>Whatever the truth of the ettins' origin, orcs treat them as distant c"
 b'ousins, and orc tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and m'
 b"arauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its orc handlers, but the orc"
 b's can win it over with the promise of food and loot.</p></div></div></div></'
