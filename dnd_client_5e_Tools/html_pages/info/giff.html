 b'amus-headed humanoids attired in gaudy military uniforms, with gleaming pist'
 b'ols and muskets on display. These spacefaring mercenaries are renowned for t'
 b'heir martial training and their love of explosives.</p><div class="rd__spc-i'

 b'litary Organization.</span></span> <p>Every aspect of giff society is organi'
 b'zed along military lines. From birth until death, every giff has a military '
 b'rank. It must follow orders from those of superior rank, and it can give ord'
 b"ers to those of lower rank. Promotions don't depend on age but are granted b"
 b'y a superior as a reward for valor. Giff are devoted to their children, even'
 b' as most of their education is geared toward fighting and war.</p><div class'

 b'd as warriors for hire, but they insist on serving in units composed entirel'
 b'y of giff; a giff hiring itself out individually is unheard of. Giff refuse '
 b'to fight other giff, and will never agree to a contract unless it stipulates'
 b' that they can sit out a battle rather than wage war against their kin. A gi'
 b'ff prizes the reputation of its unit above its own life. Life is fleeting, b'
 b'ut the regiment endures for generations or even centuries.</p><div class="rd'

 b'orite weapons of every giff. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, an'
 b'd the thicker the smoke it produces, the more giff love a weapon. Their skil'
 b'l with gunpowder is another reason for their popularity as mercenaries. Giff'
 b' revel in the challenge of building a bomb big enough to level a fortificati'
