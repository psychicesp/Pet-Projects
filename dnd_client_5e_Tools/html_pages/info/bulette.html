 b' to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they u'
 b'proot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind th'
 b'em. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it sho'
 b'ots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.</p><div class="rd__s'

 b', feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across. These creatures disl'
 b'ike dwarf and elf flesh, although they often kill them before realizing what'
 b' they are. A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier t'
 b'han when chasing plump halflings across an open field.</p><div class="rd__sp'
 b'c-inline-post"></div><p>A bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory'
 b' up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability o'
 b'f food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. The'
 b'se creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until t'
 b'heir panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.</p><p>All '
 b'creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food-even other '
 b'predators and bulettes. Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a '
 b"bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male's death and co"
 b'nsumption.</p></div><div class="rd__b rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3"'

 b" mad wizard's experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, "
 b'within fusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at d'
 b'ifferent times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably'
 b' reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect tha'
 b't bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into'
 b' the world.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div></td'
