Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. The barghest reverts to its true form if it dies.",

Instantaneous bursts of flame (such as a red dragon's breath or a fireball spell) don't have this effect on the barghest.",

This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body. The victim's soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released."
