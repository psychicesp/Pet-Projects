Any beast or humanoid within the area must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to use all its movement on its turns to get as close to the the mantrap as possible. An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
