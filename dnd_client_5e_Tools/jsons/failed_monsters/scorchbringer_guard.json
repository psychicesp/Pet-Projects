        "Explosive Tank": "When the guard dies, or if it rolls a 1 when checking whether its Scorchbringer action recharges, the tank on its back explodes in a 10-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the scorchbringer."
