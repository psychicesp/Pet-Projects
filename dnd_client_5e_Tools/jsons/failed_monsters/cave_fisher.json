        "Adhesive Filament": "The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the filament is grappled by the cave fisher (escape DC 13+1d4 + 11), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament causes no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement filament on its next turn",
        "Flammable Blood": "If the cave fisher drops to half its hit points or fewer, it gains vulnerability to fire damage.",
        "Spider Climb": "The cave fisher can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check."
