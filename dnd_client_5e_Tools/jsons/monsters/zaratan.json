That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25+1d14 + 18 Constitution saving throw or the creature's concentration is broken.",

A creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is knocked prone."
