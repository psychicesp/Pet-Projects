Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain or snow falls there, causing the area to be lightly obscured. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.",

Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 20+1d14 + 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
            "Screaming Gale (Costs 3 Actions)": "The tempest releases a blast of thunder and wind in a line that is 1 mile long and 20 feet wide. Objects in that area take 22 (4d10) thunder damage. Each creature there must succeed on a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) thunder damage and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown target collides with an immovable object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact. If the target would collide with another creature instead, that other creature must succeed on a DC 19+1d14 + 12 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone."
