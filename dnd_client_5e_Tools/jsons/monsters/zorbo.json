Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature wearing armor, carrying a shield, or in possession of a magic item that improves its AC, it must make a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, one such item worn or carried by the creature (the target's choice) magically deteriorates, taking a permanent and cumulative xe2x88x921 penalty to the AC it offers, and the zorbo gains a +1 bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed."
