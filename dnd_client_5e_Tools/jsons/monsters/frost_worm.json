        "Death Burst": "When the worm dies, it explodes in a burst of frigid energy. Each creature within 60 feet of it must make a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures inside the worm when it dies automatically fail this saving throw.",

        "Tunneler": "The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake."
