        "Evil Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)": "As an action, a Vistana can target a creature within 10 feet that the Vistana can see. This magical ability, which the Vistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the animal friendship, charm person, or hold person spell (Vistana's choice; spell DC 10+1d4 + 8), but requires neither somatic nor material components. If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana's next turn."
