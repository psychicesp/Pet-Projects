When it teleports, the specter appears astride the gloamwing along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying. While mounted and not incapacitated, the specter can't be surprised, and both it and its mount gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws."

The creature regains the memory only if the specter dies within the next 24 hours."
