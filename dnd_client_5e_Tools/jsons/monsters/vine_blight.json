In addition, each creature of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Strength saving throw or become restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Strength check, freeing it self or another entangled creature within reach on a success."
