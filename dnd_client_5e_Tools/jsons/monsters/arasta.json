The web is difficult terrain, its area is lightly obscured, and it lasts for 1 minute. Any creature that moves into the web or that starts its turn there must make a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained while in the web. A creature can use an action to make a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Strength check. On a success, it can free itself or a creature within 5 feet of it that is restrained by the web. This webbing is immune to all damage except magical fire. A 5-foot cube of the web is destroyed if it takes at least 20 fire damage from a spell or other magical source on a single turn."
