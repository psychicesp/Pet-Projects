On a failed save, the creature is poisoned and can't regain hit points until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this plague spreader's Viral Aura for 24 hours."

Each creature in that area must make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and rises as a zombie (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) 1 minute later. The zombie acts immediately after the plague spreader in the initiative count."
