This magical ability, which the Vistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the animal friendship, charm person, or hold person spell (Vistana's choice; spell DC 12+1d4 + 10), but requires neither somatic nor material components. If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana's next turn."
