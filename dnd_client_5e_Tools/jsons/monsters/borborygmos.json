A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The first time Borborygmos enters a creature's space during this move, the creature must make a DC 21+1d12 + 15 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is pushed 5 feet away from Borborygmos. If the saving throw fails, that creature is knocked prone, and Borborygmos can make a stomp attack against it."
