        "Bound Together": "The drowned master shares its mind with every other drowned one within 1 mile of it, and can communicate its thoughts and observations to them instantaneously and without limitation.",
        "Cold Aura": "At the start of each of the drowned master's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) cold damage. A creature that touches the drowned master or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) cold damage.",
        "Undead Fortitude": "If damage reduces the drowned master to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the drowned master drops to 1 hit point instead."

The target must succeed on a DC 15+1d8 + 11 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. On a failed save, the target also contracts bluerot (see the \"Bluerot\" in notes).",
        "Necrotic Ink (Recharge 5xe2x80x936)": "The drowned master discharges foul ink in front of itself in a 30-foot cone.

A creature that fails this saving throw is blinded until the end of its next turn and contracts bluerot (see the \"Bluerot\" in notes)."
