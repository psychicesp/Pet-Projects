While attached, the carrion stalker moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.",

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns as larvae infest its body. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any effect that cures disease or removes the poisoned condition instantly kills the larvae in the creature, ending the effect on it."
