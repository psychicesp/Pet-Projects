While mounted and not incapacitated, the archon can't be surprised, and both it and its mount gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the archon's Pacifying Presence for the next 24 hours."
