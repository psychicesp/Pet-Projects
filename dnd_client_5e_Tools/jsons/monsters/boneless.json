The target must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength saving throw at the start of each of the boneless' turns or take 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If something moves the target, the boneless moves with it. The boneless can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can use its action to try to detach the boneless and force it to move into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength check. When the boneless dies, it detaches from any creature it is attached to."
