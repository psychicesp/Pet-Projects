Choose one of the following options for what appears:One beast of challenge rating 2 or lowerTwo beasts of challenge rating 1 or lowerFour beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lowerEight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lowerEach beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures' statistics.",
