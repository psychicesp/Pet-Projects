actions:
    Eldritch Turret: 'Ranged Spell Attack: +18+1d16 + 10 to hit, range 300 ft., one
        target. Hit: 18 (4d8) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is
        knocked prone.'
    Incinerating Beam (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The colossus fires a beam of light in
        a 150-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make
        a DC 26+1d16 + 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 60 (11d10) radiant damage
        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced
        to 0 hit points by this beam is disintegrated, leaving behind anything it
        was wearing or carrying.
    Multiattack: The colossus makes three attacksxe2x80x94one with its slam and two
        with its eldritch turretsxe2x80x94and then uses Stomp.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +18+1d16 + 10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        29 (3d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the colossus can push the target up
        to 20 feet away from it.'
    Stomp: The colossus stomps one of its feet at a point on the ground within 20
        feet of it. Any creature in a 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered
        on this point must succeed on a DC 26+1d16 + 18 Dexterity saving throw or
        take 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Until the colossus uses
        its Stomp again or moves, the creature is restrained. While restrained in
        this way, the creature (or another creature within 5 feet of it) can use its
        action to make a DC 26+1d16 + 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature
        relocates to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the colossus
        and is no longer restrained.
