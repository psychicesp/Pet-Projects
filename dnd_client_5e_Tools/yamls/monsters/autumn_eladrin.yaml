    Enchanting Presence: Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet
        of the eladrin must make a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
        save, the creature is charmed by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful
        save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Enchanting Presence for
        24 hours.
    "Fey Step (Recharge 4\u20136)": As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up
