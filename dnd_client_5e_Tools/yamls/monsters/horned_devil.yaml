        Hit: 14 (4d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn''t
        being worn or carried, it also catches fire.'
    Multiattack: 'The devil makes three melee attacks: two with its fork and one with
        its tail. It can use Hurl Flame in place of any melee attack.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead
        or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Constitution saving throw
        or lose 10 (3d6) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal
        wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage
        dealt by the wound increases by 10 (3d6). Any creature can take an action
        to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12+1d8 + 8 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
        The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.'
