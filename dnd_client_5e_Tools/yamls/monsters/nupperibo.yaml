    Cloud of Vermin: Any creature, other than a devil, that starts its turn within
        20 feet of the nupperibo must make a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Constitution saving throw.
        A creature within the areas of two or more nupperibos makes the saving throw
        with disadvantage. On a failure, the creature takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage.
    Hunger-Driven: In the Nine Hells, the nupperibos can flawlessly track any creature
        that has taken damage from any nupperibo's Cloud of Vermin within the previous
        24 hours.
