AC: 16

HP: 58 (9d8 + 18)
actions:
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
        (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.'
    Filament: One creature grappled by the cave fisher's adhesive filament must make
        a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength saving throw, provided that the target weighs 200
        pounds or less. On a failure, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space
        within 5 feet of the cave fisher, and the cave fisher makes a claw attack
        against it as a bonus action. Reeling up the target releases anyone else who
        was attached to the filament. Until the grapple ends on the target, the cave
        fisher can't extrude another filament.
    Multiattack: The cave fisher makes two attacks with its claws.

traits:
    Adhesive Filament: The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament
        up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature
        adhered to the filament is grappled by the cave fisher (escape DC 13+1d4 +
        11), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The
        filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic
        damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring
        an action and a successful DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength check to pull free. Destroying
        the filament causes no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement
        filament on its next turn
    Flammable Blood: If the cave fisher drops to half its hit points or fewer, it
        gains vulnerability to fire damage.
    Spider Climb: The cave fisher can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down
        on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
