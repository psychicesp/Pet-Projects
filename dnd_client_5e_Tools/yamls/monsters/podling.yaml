traits:
    Semblance of Life: The podling is a physical copy of a creature digested by a
        bodytaker plant. The podling has the digested creature's memories and behaves
        like that creature, but with occasional lapses. An observer familiar with
        the digested creature can recognize the discrepancies with a successful DC
        20+1d4 + 18 Wisdom (Insight) check, or automatically if the podling does something
        in direct contradiction to the digested creature's established beliefs or
        behavior. The podling melts into a slurry when it dies, when the bodytaker
        plant that created it dies, or when the bodytaker plant dismisses it (no action
        required).
    Unusual Nature: The podling doesn't require sleep.
