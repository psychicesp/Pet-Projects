    actions:
    - The lich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has
        no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.
    - The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord
        of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes
        damage, the target must make a DC 18+1d14 + 11 Constitution saving throw.
        On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target
        takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on
        the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich's
        lair.
    - The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions
        materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of
        it. The target must succeed on a DC 18+1d14 + 11 Constitution saving throw,
        taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
        on a success. The apparitions then disappear.
