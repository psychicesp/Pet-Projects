actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8
        (2d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.'

    Discordant Song: Aphemia shrieks a cacophony of magical sounds. Each humanoid
        within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Wisdom saving throw
        or be frightened of her until the song ends. A frightened creature takes 7
        (2d6) psychic damage at the start of its turn while Aphemia is singing. A
        frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
        turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw
        is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Aphemia's
        Discordant Song for the next 24 hours. Aphemia must take a bonus action on
        her subsequent turns to continue singing. She can stop singing at any time.
        The song ends if Aphemia is incapacitated or dies.
    Grave Calling Song: Aphemia intones a low, growling magical melody. Every undead
        within 300 feet of her must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Wisdom saving throw
        or fall under her control until the song ends. Aphemia must take a bonus action
        on her subsequent turns to continue singing, and she can mentally command
        the undead under her control as part of the same bonus action. She can stop
        singing at any time. The song ends if Aphemia is incapacitated or dies.
    Multiattack: 'Aphemia makes two attacks: one with her bite and one with her claws.'
