traits:
    Nilbogism: Any creature that attempts to damage the nilbog must first succeed
        on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the end of the
        creature's next turn. A creature charmed in this way must use its action praising
        the nilbog. The nilbog can't regain hit points, including through magical
        healing, except through its Reversal of Fortune reaction.
    Nimble Escape: The nilbog can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action
        on each of its turns.
