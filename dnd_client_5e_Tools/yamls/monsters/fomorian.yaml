    Curse of the Evil Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): With a stare, the
        fomorian uses Evil Eye, but on a failed save, the creature is also cursed
        with magical deformities. While deformed, the creature has its speed halved
        and has disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks based on
        Strength or Dexterity.
    Evil Eye: The fomorian magically forces a creature it can see within 60 feet of
        it to make a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Charisma saving throw. The creature takes 27 (6d8)
        psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    Greatclub: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d6 + 6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
        Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.'
    Multiattack: The fomorian attacks twice with its greatclub or makes one greatclub
        attack and uses Evil Eye once.
