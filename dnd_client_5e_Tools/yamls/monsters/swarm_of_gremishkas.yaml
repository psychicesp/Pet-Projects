traits:
    Limited Spell Immunity: The swarm automatically succeeds on saving throws against
        spells of 3rd level or lower, and the attack rolls of such spells always miss
        it.
    Swarm: The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm
        can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny gremishka. The swarm
        can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
