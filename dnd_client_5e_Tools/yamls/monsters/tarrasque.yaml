actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19+1d18 + 10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled
        (escape DC 20+1d18 + 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,
        and the tarrasque can''t bite another target.'
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19+1d18 + 10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.'
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of
        it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17+1d18 + 8 Wisdom saving throw or
        become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within
        line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
        throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
        tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
    Horns: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19+1d18 + 10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five
        attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one
        with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.'
    Swallow: The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature
        it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the
        target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is
        blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects
        outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of
        each of the tarrasque's turns.
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +19+1d18 + 10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
        on a DC 20+1d18 + 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.'
