actions:
    Divine Dread: Each creature within 60 feet of the eidolon that can see it must
        succeed on a DC 15+1d8 + 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
        While frightened in this way, the creature must take the Dash action and move
        away from the eidolon by the safest available route at the start of each of
        its turns, unless there is nowhere for it to move, in which case the creature
        also becomes stunned until it can move again. A frightened target can repeat
        the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
        on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends
        for it, the target is immune to any eidolon's Divine Dread for the next 24
        hours.

traits:
    Incorporeal Movement: The eidolon can move through other creatures and objects
        as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends
        its turn inside an object other than a sacred statue.
    Sacred Animation (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): When the eidolon moves into a space occupied
        by a sacred statue, the eidolon can disappear, causing the statue to become
        a creature under the eidolon's control. The eidolon uses the sacred statue's
        statistics in place of its own.
    Turn Resistance: The eidolon has advantage on saving throws against any effect
        that turns undead.
