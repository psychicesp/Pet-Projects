    Change Shape: The gingwatzim changes from its true formxe2x80x94a 3-foot-diameter
        sphere of luminous ectoplasmxe2x80x94into one of its two alternate forms,
        or from one of those forms back into its true form. In object form, it can't
        move or make attacks but otherwise retains its statistics, and it is indistinguishable
        from the thing it is imitating. In beast form, it retains its hit points but
        otherwise uses the stat block of the beast it is imitating. When it dies,
        the gingwatzim reverts to its true form and then vanishes.
    Energy Drain (True Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach
        5 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (4d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target must
        succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.
        When the target finishes a short or long rest, the target loses every level
        of exhaustion gained from this attack.'

    Alternate Forms: The gingwatzim has two alternate forms, both of which are chosen
        by its creator when the gingwatzim comes into being. One form is an exact
        duplicate of a Tiny nonmagical object (such as a book, dagger, or gemstone)
        that its creator is carrying or wearing when the gingwatzim is conjured. The
        other form can be any Tiny beast. Once these alternate forms are chosen, they
        can't be changed.
