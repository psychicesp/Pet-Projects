traits:
    Fey Ancestry: The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and
        magic can't put the drow to sleep.
    Gunslinger: Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range
        doesn't impose disadvantage on the drow's ranged attack rolls with a pistol.
        In addition, the drow ignores half cover and three-quarters cover when making
        ranged attacks with a pistol.
    Sunlight Sensitivity: While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls,
        as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
