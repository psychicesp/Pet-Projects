actions:
    Enslave (3/Day): The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of
        it. The target must succeed on a DC 14+1d8 + 10 Wisdom saving throw or be
        magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on
        a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under
        the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target
        can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.
    Multiattack: The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d8 + 5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.'
    Tentacle: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d8 + 5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
        on a DC 14+1d8 + 10 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease
        has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease.
        After 1 minute, the diseased creature''s skin becomes translucent and slimy,
        the creature can''t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease
        can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or
        higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid
        damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes
        have passed.'

    actions:
    - The aboleth casts phantasmal force (no components required) on any number of
        creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration
        on this effect, the aboleth can't take other lair actions. If a target succeeds
        on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to
        the aboleth's phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although
        such a creature can choose to be affected.
    - Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide.
        Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a
        DC 14+1d8 + 10 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water
        and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has
        used a different one.
    - Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage.
        The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within
        90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14+1d8 + 10 Wisdom saving throw
        or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again
        until it has used a different one.
