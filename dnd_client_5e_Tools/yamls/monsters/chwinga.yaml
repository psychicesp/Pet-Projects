    Magical Gift (1/Day): The chwinga targets a humanoid it can see within 5 feet
        of it. The target gains a supernatural charm of the DM's choice. See chapter
        7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for more information on supernatural charms.
    Natural Shelter: The chwinga magically takes shelter inside a rock, a living plant,
        or a natural source of fresh water in its space. The chwinga can't be targeted
        by any attack, spell, or other effect while inside this shelter, and the shelter
        doesn't impair the chwinga's blindsight. The chwinga can use it's action to
        emerge from a shelter. If its shelter is destroyed, the chwinga is forced
        out and appears in the shelter's space, but is otherwise unharmed.

traits:
    Evasion: When the chwinga is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity
        saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds
        on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
    Unusual Nature: The chwinga doesn't require air, food, or drink. When it dies,
        it turns into a handful of flower petals, a cloud of pollen, a stone statuette
        resembling its former self, a tiny sphere of smooth stone, or a puddle of
        fresh water (your choice).
