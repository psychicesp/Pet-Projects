    Change Shape (2/Day): The archdruid magically polymorphs into a beast or elemental
        with a challenge rating of 6 or less, and can remain in this form for up to
        9 hours. The archdruid can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground,
        melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The archdruid reverts
        to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The archdruid can revert
        to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.
