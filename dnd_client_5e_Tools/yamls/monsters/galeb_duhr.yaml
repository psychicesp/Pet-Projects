actions:
    Animate Boulders (1/Day): The galeb duhr magically animates up to two boulders
        it can see within 60 feet of it. A boulder has statistics like those of a
        galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed
        or frightened, and it lacks this action option. A boulder remains animated
        as long as the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to 1 minute (as if concentrating
        on a spell).
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d6 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12
        (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.'

traits:
    False Appearance: While the galeb duhr remains motionless, it is indistinguishable
        from a normal boulder.
    Rolling Charge: If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 feet straight toward a target
        and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an
        extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
        on a DC 16+1d6 + 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
