CR: 19 (22,000 XP)
HP: 161 (19d8 + 76)
actions:
    Arcane Blast: 'Ranged Spell Attack: +13+1d12 + 7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.
        Hit: 12 (1d10 + 7) force damage.'
    Mind Seed (1/Day): The quori touches one humanoid, which must succeed on a DC
        21+1d12 + 15 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed. The curse lasts until
        it's removed by a remove curse or greater restoration spell.
    Multiattack: The quori makes two Soul Binding attacks. Alternatively, it can make
        four attacks with Arcane Blast.
    Possession (Recharge 6): One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of
        it must succeed on a DC 21+1d12 + 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed
        by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and
        loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive
        the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell,
        or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
        and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed
        target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class
        features, or proficiencies.
    Soul Binding: 'Melee Spell Attack: +13+1d12 + 7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 29 (4d10 + 7) necrotic damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from
        this attack dies and has its soul imprisoned in one of the quori''s eyes.
        The target can''t be revived by any means short of a wish spell until the
        quori is destroyed.'
    Swarm of Eyes (Recharge 6): The quori creates a swarm of spectral eyes that fills
        a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it.
        Each creature in that area must make a DC 21+1d12 + 15 Wisdom saving throw.
        On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage, and it is blinded
        for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't
        blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
        of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
