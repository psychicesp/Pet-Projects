actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.'
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage.'
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet
        of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19+1d14 + 12 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks:
        one with its bite and two with its claws.'
    "Poison Breath (Recharge 5\u20136)": The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 90-foot
        cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22+1d14 + 15 Constitution
        saving throw, taking 77 (22d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
        much damage on a successful one.
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.'

    actions:
    - Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the
        ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult
        terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Strength
        saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed
        if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Strength
        check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this
        lair action again or when the dragon dies.
    - A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid
        surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10
        feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears,
        each creature in its area must make a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Dexterity saving throw.
        A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed
        5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it
        wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully.
        For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet
        of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15+1d14
        + 8 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall,
        taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
        a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability
        to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity
        to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses
        this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
    - Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of
        it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Wisdom saving throw or be
        charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.

            saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
            The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.'
