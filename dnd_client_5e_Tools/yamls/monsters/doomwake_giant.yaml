actions:
    Multiattack: The giant makes two slam attacks.
    Noxious Gust (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The giant exhales a mighty gust that creates
        a blast of deadly mist in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature
        in that line must make a DC 18+1d8 + 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
        save, the creature takes 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and is knocked prone. On
        a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked
        prone.
