actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d10 + 8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.'
    "Breath Weapons (Recharge 5\u20136)": The dragon uses one of the following breath
        weapons.
    Change Shape: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has
        a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It
        reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
        is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d10 + 8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.'
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet
        of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks:
        one with its bite and two with its claws.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d10 + 8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.'

        by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such
