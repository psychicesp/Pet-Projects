    Arcane Ward: The abjurer has a magical ward that has 30 hit points. Whenever the
        abjurer takes damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If the ward is reduced
        to 0 hit points, the abjurer takes any remaining damage. When the abjurer
        casts an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number
        of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.
