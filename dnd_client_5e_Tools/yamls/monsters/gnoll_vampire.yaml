        5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic
        damage. The target''s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
        necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount.

    Frightful Cackle (Hyena or Vampire Form Only): The vampire emits a bone-chilling
        cackle. Each creature of the vampire's choice that is within 120 feet of the
        vampire and can hear its cackle must succeed on a DC 15+1d6 + 12 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to the vampire's Frightful Cackle for the next 24 hours.

        bite and one with its claws.'
    Sickening Gaze (Hyena or Vampire Form Only): The vampire targets one humanoid
        it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target
        must succeed on a DC 15+1d6 + 12 Constitution saving throw against this magic
        or be poisoned for 24 hours. A creature whose saving throw is successful is
        immune to this vampire's Sickening Gaze for 24 hours.
