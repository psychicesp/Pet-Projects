traits:
    Bonded Mount: The knight is magically bound to a beast with an innate swimming
        speed trained to serve as its mount. While mounted on this beast, the knight
        gains the beast's senses and ability to breathe underwater. The bonded mount
        obeys the knight's commands. If its mount dies, the knight can train a new
        beast to serve as its bonded mount, a process requiring a month.
    Sneak Attack: The knight deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with
        a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is
        within 5 feet of an ally of the knight that isn't incapacitated and the knight
        doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
