        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a
        target's saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also stunned until
        the end of its next turn.
    Multiattack: The tempest makes two attacks with its thunderous slam.

        target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) thunder damage.'

        Lightning Strike (Costs 2 Actions): ' The tempest can cause a bolt of lightning
            to strike a point on the ground anywhere under its storm. Each creature
            within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 20+1d14 + 13 Dexterity saving
            throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as
            much damage on a successful one.'
        Move: ' The tempest moves up to its speed.'
        Screaming Gale (Costs 3 Actions): ' The tempest releases a blast of thunder
            and wind in a line that is 1 mile long and 20 feet wide. Objects in that
            area take 22 (4d10) thunder damage. Each creature there must succeed on
            a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) thunder damage
            and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown
            target collides with an immovable object, such as a wall or floor, the
            target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown
            before impact. If the target would collide with another creature instead,
            that other creature must succeed on a DC 19+1d14 + 12 Dexterity saving
            throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.'

traits:
    Air Form: The tempest can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It
        can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
    Flyby: The tempest doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an
        enemy's reach.
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the tempest fails a saving throw, it can choose
        to succeed instead.
    Living Storm: The tempest is always at the center of a storm 1d6 + 4 miles in
        diameter. Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain or snow falls there,
        causing the area to be lightly obscured. Heavy rain also extinguishes open
        flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
        hearing.
    Siege Monster: The tempest deals double damage to objects and structures.
