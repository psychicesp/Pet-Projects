traits:
    Headless Summoning (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): If the dullahan is
        reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains
        97 hit points. In addition, it summons three death's heads, one of each type,
        in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of it. The death's heads are under the
        dullahan's control and act immediately after the dullahan in the initiative
        order. Additionally, the dullahan can now use the options in the "Mythic Actions"
        section. Award a party an additional 5,900 XP (11,800 XP total) for defeating
        the dullahan after it uses Headless Summoning.

        to succeed instead.
