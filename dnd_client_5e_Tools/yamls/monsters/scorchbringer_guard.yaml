    Scorchbringer (Recharge 4xe2x80x936): The guard's scorchbringer spouts a stream

    Explosive Tank: When the guard dies, or if it rolls a 1 when checking whether
        its Scorchbringer action recharges, the tank on its back explodes in a 10-foot
        radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Dexterity
        saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects that aren't
        being worn or carried, and it destroys the scorchbringer.
