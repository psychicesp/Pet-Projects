CR: 23 (50,000 XP)
HP: 275 (19d12 + 152)
actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +17+1d14 + 10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        19 (2d8 + 10) piercing damage.'
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of Baphomet's choice within 120 feet of him
        and aware of him must succeed on a DC 18+1d14 + 11 Wisdom saving throw or
        become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        These later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of sight of
        the creature.
    Gore: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +17+1d14 + 10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        17 (2d6 + 10) piercing damage.'
    Heartcleaver: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +17+1d14 + 10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
        Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'Baphomet makes three attacks: one with Heartcleaver, one with his
        bite, and one with his gore attack.'

    actions:
    - Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must
        be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet
        creates this effect again.
    - Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than
        100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that
        room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction
        of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft.
        Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he's in the room, although he
        likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near
        it.
    - Baphomet casts mirage arcane, affecting a room within the lair that is no larger
        in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count
        20.

        + 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.

        to succeed instead.
