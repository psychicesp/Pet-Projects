actions:
    Disruptive Touch: 'Melee Spell Attack: +11+1d12 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 44 (8d10) necrotic damage.'
    Forgetfulness (Recharge 6): The amnizu targets one creature it can see within
        60 feet of it. That creature must make a DC 18+1d12 + 12 Intelligence saving
        throw and on a failure the target is stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature
        repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
        on itself on a success. If the target remains stunned for the full minute,
        it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last
        5 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The amnizu uses Poison Mind. It also makes two attacks: one with
        its whip and one with its Disruptive Touch.'
    Poison Mind: The amnizu targets one or two creatures that it can see within 60
        feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19+1d12 + 13 Wisdom saving throw
        or take 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and is blinded until the start of the amnizu's
        next turn.
    Taskmaster Whip: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +11+1d12 + 5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
        target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 33 (6d10) force damage.'
