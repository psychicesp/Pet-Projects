        subtle enchantments at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the
        target can hear the Inspired, the target must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11
        Wisdom saving throw or take 2 (1d4) psychic damage and have disadvantage on
        the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
