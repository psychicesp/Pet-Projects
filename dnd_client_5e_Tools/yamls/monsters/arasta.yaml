AC: 19
HP: 300 (24d12 + 144)
actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +14+1d14 + 7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Constitution
        saving throw, taking 32 (5d12) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
        much damage on a successful one. If the damage reduces the target to 0 hit
        points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining
        hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.'
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +14+1d14 + 7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        17 (3d6 + 7) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'Arasta makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws.'
    "Web of Hair (Recharge 4\u20136)": Arasta unleashes her hair in the form of webbing
        that fills a 30-foot cube next to her. The web is difficult terrain, its area
        is lightly obscured, and it lasts for 1 minute. Any creature that moves into
        the web or that starts its turn there must make a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Dexterity
        saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained while in the web.
        A creature can use an action to make a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Strength check. On
        a success, it can free itself or a creature within 5 feet of it that is restrained
        by the web. This webbing is immune to all damage except magical fire. A 5-foot
        cube of the web is destroyed if it takes at least 20 fire damage from a spell
        or other magical source on a single turn.
