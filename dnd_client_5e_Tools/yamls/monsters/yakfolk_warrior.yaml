traits:
    Possession (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The yakfolk attempts to magically
        possess a humanoid or giant. The yakfolk must touch the target throughout
        a short rest, or the attempt fails. At the end of the rest, the target must
        succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw or be possessed by the
        yakfolk, which disappears with everything it is carrying and wearing. Until
        the possession ends, the target is incapacitated, loses control of its body,
        and is unaware of its surroundings. The yakfolk now controls the body and
        can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its
        alignment; its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; and its proficiencies.
        It otherwise uses the target's statistics, except the target's knowledge,
        class features, feats, and proficiencies.
