actions:
    Mind Twist (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The specter magically emits psychic energy
        in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15+1d8
        + 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (5d8) psychic damage and be stunned for
        1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
        of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Multiattack: The specter makes two scythe attacks.
    Reap Memory (3/Day): The specter touches one incapacitated creature and chooses
        1 hour from among the past 24. Unless the creature succeeds on a DC 15+1d8
        + 11 Intelligence saving throw, the creature loses all memory of that hour.
        The creature regains the memory only if the specter dies within the next 24
        hours.

        11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) psychic damage.'

traits:
    Mount: If the specter isn't mounted, it can use a bonus action to magically teleport
        onto its gloamwing mount, provided the specter and the gloamwing are on the
        same plane of existence. When it teleports, the specter appears astride the
        gloamwing along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying. While mounted
        and not incapacitated, the specter can't be surprised, and both it and its
        mount gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
