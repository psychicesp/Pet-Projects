traits:
    Enthralling Performance: If the satyr performs for at least 1 minute, it chooses
        up to four humanoids within 60 feet of it who watched or listened to the entire
        performance. Each target must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Wisdom saving throw
        or be charmed. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes the satyr and
        will take part in the satyr's revels. The charmed condition ends for the creature
        after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if the satyr attacks the target, or
        if the target witnesses the satyr attacking or damaging any of the target's
        allies.
    Magic Resistance: The satyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.
    Sleepless Reveler: Magic can't put the satyr to sleep.
