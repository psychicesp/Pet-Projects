actions:
    Explosive Bolt (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The oaken bolter launches an explosive
        charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of that point
        must make a DC 15+1d6 + 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage
        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    Harpoon: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target.
        Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12+1d6
        + 9). While grappled in this way, a creature''s speed isn''t reduced, but
        it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the oaken bolter. A
        creature takes 5 (1d10) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or
        if it tries and fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature
        grappled by it 20 feet closer. The oaken bolter can grapple only one creature
        at a time.'
    Lancing Bolt: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
        range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.'
    Multiattack: The oaken bolter makes two lancing bolt attacks or one lancing bolt
        attack and one harpoon attack.
