actions:
    Crushing Embrace: The boneless wraps its body around a Large or smaller creature
        grappled by it. While the boneless is attached, the target is blinded and
        is unable to breathe. The target must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength
        saving throw at the start of each of the boneless' turns or take 5 (1d4 +
        3) bludgeoning damage. If something moves the target, the boneless moves with
        it. The boneless can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature,
        including the target, can use its action to try to detach the boneless and
        force it to move into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful
        DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength check. When the boneless dies, it detaches from any
        creature it is attached to.
    Multiattack: The boneless makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Large
        or smaller creature, the creature is grappled (escape DC 13+1d4 + 11), and
        the boneless can use Crushing Embrace.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5
        (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.'
