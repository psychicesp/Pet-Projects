actions:
    Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): For 1 minute, the spy magically
        increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged,
        the spy is Large, doubles her damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks
        (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws
        with advantage. If the spy lacks the room to become Large, it attains the
        maximum size possible in the space available.
    Hand Crossbow: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one
        target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.'
    Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The spy magically turns invisible
        until it attacks, deals damage, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until
        its concentration is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell).
        Any equipment the spy wears or carries is invisible with it.
    Multiattack: The spy makes two shortsword attacks.
    Shortsword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage while enlarged.'
