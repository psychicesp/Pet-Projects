traits:
    False Appearance: While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable
        from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.
    Grasping Tendrils: The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril
        can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage).
        Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement
        tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes
        an action and succeeds on a DC 15+1d6 + 12 Strength check against it.
    Spider Climb: The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on
        ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
