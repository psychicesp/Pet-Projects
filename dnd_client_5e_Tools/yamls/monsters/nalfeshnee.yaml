    Horror Nimbus (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The nalfeshnee magically emits scintillating,
        multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that can
        see the light must succeed on a DC 15+1d10 + 10 Wisdom saving throw or be
        frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
        of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
        saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune
        to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The nalfeshnee uses Horror Nimbus if it can. It then makes three
        attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.'
    Teleport: The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing
        or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
