AC: 12
CR: 1/2 (100 XP)
HP: 26 (4d8 + 4)
actions:
    Constrict: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
        Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is grappled
        (escape DC 12+1d4 + 10). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,
        and the blight can''t constrict another target.'
    Entangling Plants (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): Grasping roots and vines sprout in a
        15-foot radius centered on the blight, withering away after 1 minute. For
        the duration, that area is difficult terrain for nonplant creatures. In addition,
        each creature of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear must
        succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Strength saving throw or become restrained. A
        creature can use its action to make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Strength check, freeing
        it self or another entangled creature within reach on a success.
