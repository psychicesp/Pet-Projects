AC: 19
CR: 18 (20,000 XP)
HP: 150 (12d12 + 72)
actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d12 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        9 (2d8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.'
    Chain: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d12 + 0 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        20 (2d12 + 7) piercing damage.'
    Multiattack: The sibriex uses Squirt Bile once and makes three attacks using its
        chain, bite, or both.
    Squirt Bile: The sibriex targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it.
        The target must succeed on a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Dexterity saving throw or take
        35 (10d6) acid damage.
    Warp Creature: The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120
        feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Constitution saving throw.
        On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature.
        On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level
        of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving
        throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the
        poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused
        by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion.
        Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms
        into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation
        of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.

    Contamination: The sibriex emits an aura of corruption 30 feet in every direction.
        Plants that aren't creatures wither in the aura, and the ground in it is difficult
        terrain for other creatures. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura
        must succeed on a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6)
        poison damage. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this sibriex's
        Contamination for 24 hours.
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the sibriex fails a saving throw, it can choose
        to succeed instead.
