traits:
    Aversion of Fire: If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack
        rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
    Berserk: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll
        a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk,
        the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near
        enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference
        for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues
        to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.
    Immutable Form: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its
        form.
    Lightning Absorption: Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it
        takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning
        damage dealt.
    Magic Resistance: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.
    Magic Weapons: The golem's weapon attacks are magical.
