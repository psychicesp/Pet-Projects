    Beard: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 +
        10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in
        this way, the target can''t regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.'
    Glaive: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead
        or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw
        or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal
        wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage
        dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take an action
        to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12+1d4 + 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
        The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.'
