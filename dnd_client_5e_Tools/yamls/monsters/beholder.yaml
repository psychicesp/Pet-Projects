    - A 50-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy;
        that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.
    - Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative
        count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder's choice that
        starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15+1d10
        + 10 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful
        DC 15+1d10 + 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
    - An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye
        ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder's choice
        that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.

    Antimagic Cone: The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in
        the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its
        turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone
        is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.
