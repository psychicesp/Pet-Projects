traits:
    Attractive Pollen (1/Day): When the mantrap detects any creatures nearby, it can
        use its reaction to release pollen out to a radius of 30 feet. Any beast or
        humanoid within the area must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Wisdom saving throw
        or be forced to use all its movement on its turns to get as close to the the
        mantrap as possible. An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the
        end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    False Appearance: While the mantrap remains motionless, it is indistinguishable
        from an ordinary tropical plant.
