traits:
    Alien Mind: If a creature tries to read the Bagman's thoughts, that creature must
        succeed on a DC DC 8+1d6 + 5 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned for 1
        minute. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
        of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Amorphous: The Bagman can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without
        squeezing.
    Grappler: The Bagman has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled
        by it.
    Keen Smell: The Bagman has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
        smell.
    Regeneration: The Bagman regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the
        Bagman takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start
        of the Bagman's next turn. The Bagman dies only if it starts its turn with
        0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
