    Possess Corpse (Recharge 6): The dybbuk disappears into an intact corpse it can
        see within 5 feet of it. The corpse must be Large or smaller and be that of
        a beast or a humanoid. The dybbuk is now effectively the possessed creature.
        Its type becomes undead, though it now looks alive, and it gains a number
        of temporary hit points equal to the corpse's hit point maximum in life.
    Tendril: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum
        is also reduced by 3 (1d6). This reduction lasts until the target finishes
        a short or long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point
        maximum to 0.'

traits:
    Incorporeal Movement: The dybbuk can move through other creatures and objects
        as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends
        its turn inside an object.
    Magic Resistance: The dybbuk has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.
    Violate Corpse: The dybbuk can use a bonus action while it is possessing a corpse
        to make it do something unnatural, such as vomit blood, twist its head all
        the way around, or cause a quadruped to move as a biped. Any beast or humanoid
        that sees this behavior must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Wisdom saving throw
        or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the
        saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
        on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this ability
        is immune to Violate Corpse for 24 hours.
