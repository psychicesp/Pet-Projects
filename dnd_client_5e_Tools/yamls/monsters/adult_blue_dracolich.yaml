actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d12 + 7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.'

    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the dracolich's choice that is within 120
        feet of the dracolich and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18+1d12 + 12 Wisdom
        saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
        saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
        on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends
        for it, the creature is immune to the dracolich's Frightful Presence for the
        next 24 hours.
    "Lightning Breath (Recharge 5\u20136)": The dracolich exhales lightning in a 90-foot
        line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 20+1d12
        + 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed
        save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d12 + 7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.'

    - Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within
        120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15+1d12 + 9 Dexterity saving
        throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried.
        The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature

        state on a success.

        throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at
