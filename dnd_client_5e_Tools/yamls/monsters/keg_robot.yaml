    Acid Squirt: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, range 20/40 ft., one target.
        Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) acid damage.'
    Beer Shower: The keg robot spews an unnaturally potent beer in a 15-foot cone
        or in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must succeed
        on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned
        in this way, a creature has its speed halved by exposure to the potent brew.
        An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
        turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Fist: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
        (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.'
    Hot Oil Spray (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The keg robot sprays hot oil in a 15-foot
        cone or in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must
        make a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
        takes 7 (1d8 + 3) fire damage and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature
        takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone.
