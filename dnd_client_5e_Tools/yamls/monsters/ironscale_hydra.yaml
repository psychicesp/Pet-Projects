traits:
    Acidic Blood: When the hydra takes piercing or slashing damage, each creature
        within 5 feet of the hydra takes 9 (2d8) acid damage.
    Hold Breath: The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.
    Multiple Heads: The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the
        hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened,
        frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. Whenever the hydra takes 35 or
        more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die,
        the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its
        heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since
        its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this
        way.
    Reactive Heads: For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction
        that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
    Wakeful: While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.
