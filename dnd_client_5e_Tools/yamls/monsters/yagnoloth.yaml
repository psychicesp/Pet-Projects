    Battlefield Cunning (Recharge 4xe2x80x936): Up to two allied yugoloths within
        60 feet of the yagnoloth that can hear it can use their reactions to make
        one melee attack each.
    Electrified Touch: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d8 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 27 (6d8) lightning damage.'
    Life Leech: The yagnoloth touches one incapacitated creature within 15 feet of
        it. The target takes 36 (7d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the yagnoloth gains
        temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The target must succeed
        on a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is
        reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until
        the target finishes a long rest, and the target dies if its hit point maximum
        is reduced to 0.
    Massive Arm: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d8 + 4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
        Hit: 23 (3d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
        succeed on a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Constitution saving throw or is stunned until
        the end of the yagnoloth''s next turn.'
    Multiattack: The yagnoloth makes one massive arm attack and one electrified touch
        attack, or it makes one massive arm attack and teleports before or after the
        attack.
    Teleport: The yagnoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing
        or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
