    Numbing Aura: Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie must
        make a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Constitution saving throw. Unless the save succeeds,
        the creature can't make more than one attack, or take a bonus action on that
        turn.
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a
        Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage
        is fire, radiant, or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to
        1 hit point instead.
