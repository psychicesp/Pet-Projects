traits:
    Acidic Blood: When Polukranos takes piercing or slashing damage, each creature
        within 5 feet of Polukranos takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.
    Hold Breath: Polukranos can hold its breath for 1 hour.
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If Polukranos fails a saving throw, it can choose
        to succeed instead.
    Multiple Heads: Polukranos has five heads. While it has more than one head, Polukranos
        has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened,
        stunned, or knocked unconscious. Whenever Polukranos takes 40 or more damage
        in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, Polukranos
        dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that
        died since its last turn, unless it has taken 40 or more fire damage since
        its last turn. Polukranos regains 20 hit points for each head regrown in this
        way.
    Reactive Heads: For each head Polukranos has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction
        that can be used only to make opportunity attacks.
    Siege Monster: Polukranos deals double damage to objects and structures.
    Wakeful: While Polukranos sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.
