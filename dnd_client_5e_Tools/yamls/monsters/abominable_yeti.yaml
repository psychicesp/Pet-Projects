actions:
    Chilling Gaze: The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it.
        If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 18+1d8 + 14
        Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 21 (6d6) cold damage
        and then be paralyzed for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The
        target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
        the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful,
        or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to this yeti's gaze for
        1 hour.
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +11+1d8 + 7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.'
    Cold Breath (Recharge 6): The yeti exhales a 30-foot cone of frigid air. Each
        creature in that area must make a DC 18+1d8 + 14 Constitution saving throw,
        taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
        successful one.
    Multiattack: The yeti can use its Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.
