CR: 2 (450 XP)
HP: 33 (6d6 + 12)
actions:
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: The vegepygmy makes two attacks with its claws or two melee attacks
        with its spear.
    Spear: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range
        20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing
        damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.'
    Spores (1/Day): A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vegepygmy.
        The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area that isn't a
        plant must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned.
        While poisoned in this way, a target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage at the start
        of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
        of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
