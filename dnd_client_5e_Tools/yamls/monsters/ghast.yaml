traits:
    Stench: Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ghast must succeed
        on a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start
        of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to
        the ghast's Stench for 24 hours.
    Turn Defiance: The ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on
        saving throws against effects that turn undead.
