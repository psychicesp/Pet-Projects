traits:
    Petrifying Gaze: When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn
        within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14+1d6
        + 11 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see
        the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly
        petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone
        and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at
        the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect
        on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater
        restoration spell or other magic.
