    Psychic Lash: The magen's eyes glow silver as it targets one creature that it

        Wisdom saving throw or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage.
    Suggestion: The magen casts the suggestion spell (save DC 12+1d4 + 10), requiring
        no material components. The target must be a creature that the magen can communicate
        with telepathically. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the target is immune
        to this magen's suggestion spell for the next 24 hours. The magen's spellcasting
