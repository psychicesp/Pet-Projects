actions:
    Bite (Giant Spider Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d10 + 2 to hit, reach
        5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must
        make a DC 15+1d10 + 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (4d12) poison
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the
        poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but
        poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while
        poisoned in this way.'
    Multiattack: The drow makes two poisonous touch attacks or two bite attacks. The
        first of these attacks that hits each round deals an extra 26 (4d12) poison
        damage to the target.
    Poisonous Touch (Humanoid Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d10 + 3 to hit,
        reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (8d6) poison damage.'
    Web (Giant Spider Form Only Recharge 5xe2x80x936): 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +8+1d10
        + 3 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: The target is restrained by
        webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 15+1d10 + 10 Strength
        check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked
        and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning,
        poison, and psychic damage).'

traits:
    Change Shape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The drow can use a bonus
        action to magically polymorph into a giant spider, remaining in that form
        for up to 1 hour. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action. Its statistics,
        other than its size, are the same in each form. It can speak and cast spells
        while in giant spider form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying in humanoid
        form melds into the giant spider form. It can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise
        benefit from any of its equipment. It reverts to its humanoid form if it dies.
    Fey Ancestry: The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and
        magic can't put the drow to sleep.
    Spider Climb: The drow can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on
        ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
    Sunlight Sensitivity: While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls,
        as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
    Web Walker: The drow ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
