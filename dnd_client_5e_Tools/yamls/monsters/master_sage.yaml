    Fireball (3rd-Level Spell; 3/Day): The sage creates a fiery explosion centered
        on a point it can see within 150 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius
        sphere centered on that point must make a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Dexterity saving
        throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
        on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable
        objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
    Shocking Grasp (Cantrip): 'Melee Spell Attack: +8+1d6 + 5 to hit (with advantage
        if the target is wearing armor made of metal), reach 5 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 13 (3d8) lightning damage, and the target can''t take reactions until
        the start of its next turn.'

        as the spellcasting ability (save DC 14+1d6 + 11, +6+1d6 + 3 to hit with spell
