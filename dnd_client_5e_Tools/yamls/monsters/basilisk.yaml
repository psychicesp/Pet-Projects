traits:
    Petrifying Gaze: If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk
        and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature
        to make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated.
        On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained.
        It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success,
        the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the
        greater restoration spell or other magic.
