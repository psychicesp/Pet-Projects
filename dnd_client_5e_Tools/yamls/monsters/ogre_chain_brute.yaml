    Chain Smash (Recharge 6): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
        one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make
        a DC 14+1d4 + 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target is unconscious
        for 1 minute. The unconscious target repeats the saving throw if it takes
        damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
        a success.'
    Chain Sweep: The ogre swings its chain, and every creature within 10 feet of it
        must make a DC 14+1d4 + 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw,
        a creature takes 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a
        successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked
        prone.
