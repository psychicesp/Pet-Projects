actions:
    Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): For 1 minute, the duergar magically
        increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged,
        the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks
        (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws
        with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains
        the maximum size possible in the space available.
    Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The duergar magically turns
        invisible for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, it uses
        its Enlarge, or its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).
        Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it.
