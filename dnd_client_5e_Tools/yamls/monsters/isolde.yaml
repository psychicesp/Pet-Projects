actions:
    Fiendish Charm: One humanoid Isolde can see within 30 feet of it must succeed
        on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day.
        The charmed target obeys Isolde's spoken commands. If the target suffers any
        harm from Isolde or another creature or receives a suicidal command from Isolde,
        the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to Isolde's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.
    Fire Ray: 'Ranged Spell Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.
        Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage.'
    Multiattack: Isolde makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.
    Nepenthe: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d6 + 7 to hit, reach 5 ft.., one target.
        Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage, or 12 (1d10 + 7) slashing damage if used
        with two hands to make a melee attack. If the target is a fiend or an undead,
        it takes an extra 11 (2d10) radiant damage.'
