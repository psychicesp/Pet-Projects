traits:
    Adhesive (Object Form Only): The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A
        Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape
        DC 16+1d6 + 13). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
    False Appearance (Object Form Only): While the mimic remains motionless, it is
        indistinguishable from an ordinary object.
    Grappler: The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled
        by it.
    Magic Resistance: The mimic has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.
    Shapechanger: The mimic can use its action to polymorph into an object or back
        into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any
        equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true
        form if it dies.
