traits:
    Charge: If the hart moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits
        it with an antlers attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6)
        fire damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 +
        11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
    Heated Body: A creature that touches the hart or hits it with a melee attack while
        within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.
    Sure-Footed: The hart has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made
        against effects that would knock it prone.
