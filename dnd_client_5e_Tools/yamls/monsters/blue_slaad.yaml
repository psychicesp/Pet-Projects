    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d6 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12
        (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on
        a DC 15+1d6 + 12 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called
        chaos phage. While infected, the target can''t regain hit points, and its
        hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces
        the target''s hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into

        a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.'
