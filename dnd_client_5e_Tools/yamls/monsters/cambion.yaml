actions:
    Fiendish Charm: One humanoid the cambion can see within 30 feet of it must succeed
        on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day.
        The charmed target obeys the cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers
        any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command
        from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect
        on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the
        effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm
        for the next 24 hours.
    Fire Ray: 'Ranged Spell Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.
        Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage.'
    Multiattack: The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.
    Spear: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range
        20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing
        damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.'
