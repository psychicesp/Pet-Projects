traits:
    Charge: If the goat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits
        it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) bludgeoning
        damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Strength
        saving throw or be knocked prone.
    Sure-Footed: The goat has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made
        against effects that would knock it prone.
