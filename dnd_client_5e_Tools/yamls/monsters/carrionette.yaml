    Silver Needle: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 1 piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed
        on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Charisma saving throw or become cursed for 1 minute. While
        cursed in this way, the target''s speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it must
        roll a 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from each ability check or attack
        roll it makes.'
    Soul Swap: The carrionette targets a creature it can see within 15 feet of it
        that is cursed by its Silver Needle. Unless the target is protected by a protection
        from evil and good spell, it must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Charisma saving
        throw or have its consciousness swapped with the carrionette. The carrionette
        gains control of the target's body, and the target is unconscious for 1 hour,
        after which it gains control of the carrionette's body. While controlling
        the target's body, the carrionette retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
        scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain
        access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
