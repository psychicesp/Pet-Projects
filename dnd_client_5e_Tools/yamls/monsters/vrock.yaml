AC: 15
CR: 6 (2,300 XP)
HP: 104 (11d10 + 44)
actions:
    Beak: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
        (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its
        talons.'
    Spores (Recharge 6): A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the
        vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed
        on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned
        in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of
        its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
        turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water
        on the target also ends the effect on it.
    Stunning Screech (1/Day): The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within
        20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC
        14+1d6 + 11 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the vrock's
        next turn.
    Talons: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.'
