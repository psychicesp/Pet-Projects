actions:
    Change Shape: The oni magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid, into
        a Large giant, or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics
        are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is its glaive,
        which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If the oni dies,
        it reverts to its true form, and its glaive reverts to its normal size.
    Claw (Oni Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
        target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Glaive: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage in Small or
        Medium form.'
    Multiattack: The oni makes two attacks, either with its claws or its glaive.
