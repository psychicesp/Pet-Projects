CR: 5 (1,800 XP) or 7 (2,900 XP) whe part of a cove
HP: 112 (15d8 + 45)
actions:
    Change Shape: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid,
        or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any
        equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her
        true form if she dies.
    Claws (Hag Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
        target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Etherealness: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane,
        or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.
    Nightmare Haunting (1/Day): While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches
        a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good
        spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As
        long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions
        last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its
        hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's
        hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul
        is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point
        maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

    actions:
    - Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid
        walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.
    - The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each
        one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked
        (requiring a successful DC 20+1d6 + 17 Strength check to force open) until
        she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again
        to open them.
    - One creature the hag can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 15
        Charisma saving throw or be banished to a prison demiplane. To escape, the
        creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the hag's.
        If the creature wins, it escapes the demiplane. Otherwise, the effect ends
        on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature
        reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that
        one is occupied.
    - The hag targets up to three creatures that she can see within 60 feet of her.
        Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be flung
        up to 30 feet through the air. A creature that strikes a solid object or is
        released in midair takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved or
        fallen.

    Magic Resistance: The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
        magical effects.
    Night Hag Items: A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft
        for herself. If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths
        to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.
