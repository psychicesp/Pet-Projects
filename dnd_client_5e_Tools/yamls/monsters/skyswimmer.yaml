    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +11+1d10 + 6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature,
        it must succeed on a DC 19+1d10 + 14 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed
        by the skyswimmer. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has
        total cover against attacks and other effects outside the skyswimmer, and
        it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the skyswimmer''s turns.
        If the skyswimmer takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed
        creature, the skyswimmer must succeed on a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Constitution saving
        throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone
        in a space within 10 feet of the skyswimmer. If the skyswimmer dies, a swallowed
        creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using
        15 feet of movement, exiting prone.'
