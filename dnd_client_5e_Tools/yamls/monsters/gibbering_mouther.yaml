actions:
    Bites: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +2+1d4 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed
        on a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target
        is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the mouther.'
    Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The mouther spits a chemical glob at
        a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash
        of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed
        on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of
        the mouther's next turn.
    Multiattack: The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, uses
        its Blinding Spittle.

traits:
    Aberrant Ground: The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is doughlike
        difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed
        on a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until
        the start of its next turn.
    Gibbering: The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and
        isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of
        the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Wisdom
        saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start
        of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn.
        On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no
        action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined
        direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly
        determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such
        an attack.
