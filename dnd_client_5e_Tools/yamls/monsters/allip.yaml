actions:
    Howling Babble (Recharge 6): Each creature within 30 feet of the allip that can
        hear it must make a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
        a target takes 12 (2d8 + 3) psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end
        of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't
        stunned. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.
    Maddening Touch: 'Melee Spell Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage.'
    Whispers of Madness: The allip chooses up to three creatures it can see within
        60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Wisdom saving
        throw, or it takes 7 (1d8 + 3) psychic damage and must use its reaction to
        make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the allip's choice that
        the allip can see. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.
