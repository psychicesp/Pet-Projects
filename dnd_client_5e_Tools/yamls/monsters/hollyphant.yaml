    Trumpet (3/Day): 'The hollyphant blows air through its trunk, creating a trumpet
        sound that can be heard out to a range of 600 feet. The trumpet also creates
        a 30-foot cone of energy that has one of the following effects, chosen by
        the hollyphant:'
    Trumpet of Blasting: Each creature in the cone must make a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Constitution
        saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 17 (5d6) thunder damage and
        is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
        damage and isn't deafened. Nonmagical objects in the cone that aren't being
        held or worn take 35 (10d6) thunder damage.
    Trumpet of Sparkles: Creatures in the cone must make a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Constitution
        saving throw, taking 22 (4d8 + 4) radiant damage on a failed save, or half
        as much damage on a successful one. Evil creatures have disadvantage on the
        saving throw. Good creatures in the cone take no damage.
    Tusks: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +3+1d6 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        3 (1d6) piercing damage.'

traits:
    Aura of Invulnerability: An invisible aura forms a 10-foot-radius sphere around
        the hollyphant for as long as it lives. Any spell of 5th level or lower cast
        from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even
        if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target
        creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them.
        Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected
        by such spells. The hollyphant can use an action to suppress this trait until
        its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
    Magic Weapons: The hollyphant's weapon attacks are magical.
