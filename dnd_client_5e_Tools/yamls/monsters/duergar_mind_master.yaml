actions:
    Invisibility (Recharge 4xe2x80x936): The duergar magically turns invisible for
        up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, it uses its Reduce, or
        its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment
        the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it.
    Mind Mastery: The duergar targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it.
        The target must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Intelligence saving throw, or
        the duergar causes it to use its reaction either to make one weapon attack
        against another creature the duergar can see or to move up to 10 feet in a
        direction of the duergar's choice. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune
        to this effect.
    Mind-Poison Dagger: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
        target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage and 10 (3d6) psychic damage, or 1
        piercing damage and 14 (4d6) psychic damage while reduced.'
    Multiattack: The duergar makes two melee attacks. It can replace one of those
        attacks with a use of Mind Mastery.
    Reduce (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): For 1 minute, the duergar magically
        decreases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While reduced,
        the duergar is Tiny, reduces its weapon damage to 1, and makes attacks, checks,
        and saving throws with disadvantage if they use Strength. It gains a +5 bonus
        to all Dexterity (Stealth) checks and a +5 bonus to its AC. It can also take
        a bonus action on each of its turns to take the Hide action.
