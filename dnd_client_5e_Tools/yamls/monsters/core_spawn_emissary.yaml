actions:
    Alluring Thrum (Recharges 5-6): The emissary emits a dreadful yet alluring hum.
        Each creature within 20 feet of the emissary that can hear it and that isn't
        an aberration must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Constitution saving throw or
        be charmed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
        of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Crystal Spores (Recharge 6): A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic crystalline spores
        extends out from the emissary. The spores spread around corners. Each creature
        in the area must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Constitution saving throw or
        become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature takes 11 (2d10) poison
        damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Multiattack: The emissary makes three talons attacks.
    Talons: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.'
