actions:
    Gaze: Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature that he can see within
        120 feet of him. That target must make a DC 23+1d16 + 15 Wisdom saving throw.
        Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze
        and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't
        see Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks at him
        in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
    Multiattack: Demogorgon makes two tentacle attacks.
    Tentacle: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +17+1d16 + 9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
        Hit: 28 (3d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
        succeed on a DC 23+1d16 + 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum
        is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until
        the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum
        is reduced to 0.'

    actions:
    - Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own
        space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn,
        Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking
        speed (no action required). The first time a creature or object interacts
        physically with Demogorgon (for example, hitting him with an attack), there
        is a 50 percent chance that it is the illusory duplicate that is being affected,
        not Demogorgon himself, in which case the illusion disappears.
    - Demogorgon casts the darkness spell four times at its lowest level, targeting
        different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on
        the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.
