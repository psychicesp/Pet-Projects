CR: 3 (700 XP)
HP: 42 (4d10 + 20)
actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15+1d4 +
        13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned
        creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
        the effect on itself on a success.'
    Siphon Life (Recharge 4xe2x80x936): The nergaliid magically draws the life from
        a humanoid it can see within 40 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15+1d4
        + 13 Wisdom saving throw. An incapacitated target fails the save automatically.
        On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the nergaliid
        gains temporary hit points equal to the damage taken. On a successful save,
        the target takes half as much damage, and the nergaliid doesn't gain temporary
        hit points. If this damage kills the target, its body rises at the end of
        the nergaliid's current turn as a husk zombie (see earlier in this chapter).
    Tongue Lash: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
        Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage.'
