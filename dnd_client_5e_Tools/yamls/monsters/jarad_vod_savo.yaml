traits:
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If Jarad fails a saving throw, he can choose to
        succeed instead.
    Magic Resistance: Jarad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
        magical effects.
    Regeneration: Jarad regains 25 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes
        fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next
        turn. He dies only if he starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
    Spore Infusion: Jarad is surrounded by a cloud of spores. As a bonus action, he
        can cause the spores to deal 11 (2d10) poison damage to a creature he can
        see within 10 feet of him.
    Turn Resistance: Jarad has advantage on saving throws against any effect that
        turns undead.
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces Jarad to 0 hit points, he must make a Constitution
        saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant
        or from a critical hit. On a success, he drops to 1 hit point instead.
