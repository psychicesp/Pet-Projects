    Aggressive: As a bonus action, the zombie can move up to its speed toward a hostile
        creature that it can see.
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a
        Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage
        is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit
        point instead.
