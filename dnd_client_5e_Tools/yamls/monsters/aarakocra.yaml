    Javelin: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range
        30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.'
    Summon Air Elemental: Five aarakocra within 30 feet of each other can magically
        summon an air elemental. Each of the five must use its action and movement
        on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration
        while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished
        their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space
        within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken
        commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until
        any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform
        the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns
        to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return
        with it.
    Talon: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
