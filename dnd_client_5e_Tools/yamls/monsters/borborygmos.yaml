    Frightful Presence: Each creature of Borborygmos's choice that is within 60 feet
        of him and can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 17+1d12 + 11 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened of him for 1 minute. The frightened creature can
        repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
        on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the
        effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Borborygmos's Frightful Presence
        for the next 24 hours.

        28 (6d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
        on a DC 21+1d12 + 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.'

        Bellow (Costs 2 Actions): ' Borborygmos yells menacingly at one creature he
            can see within 60 feet of him. That creature must succeed on a DC 17+1d12
            + 11 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of him for 1 minute. If
            the creature is already frightened, it becomes stunned instead. A creature
            can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
            effect on itself on a success. If a creature''s saving throw is successful
            or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Borborygmos''s Bellow
            for the next 24 hours.'
        Wide Berth (Costs 3 Actions): ' Borborygmos moves up to half his speed and
            can move through the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first
            time Borborygmos enters a creature''s space during this move, the creature
            must make a DC 21+1d12 + 15 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw
            succeeds, the creature is pushed 5 feet away from Borborygmos. If the
            saving throw fails, that creature is knocked prone, and Borborygmos can
            make a stomp attack against it.'
