traits:
    Fiery Death and Rebirth: When the phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature within
        60-feet of it must make a DC 20+1d10 + 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22
        (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't worn or carried.
    Fire Form: The phoenix can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without
        squeezing. Any creature that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack
        while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the phoenix
        can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters
        a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. With
        a touch, the phoenix can also ignite flammable objects that aren't worn or
        carried (no action required).
    Flyby: The phoenix doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an
        enemy's reach.
    Illumination: The phoenix sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light
        for an additional 30 feet.
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the phoenix fails a saving throw, it can choose
        to succeed instead.
    Siege Monster: The phoenix deals double damage to objects and structures.
