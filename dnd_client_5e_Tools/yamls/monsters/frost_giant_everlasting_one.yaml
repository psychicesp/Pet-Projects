traits:
    Extra Heads: The giant has a 25 percent chance of having more than one head. If
        it has more than one, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on
        saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned,
        or knocked unconscious.
    Regeneration: The giant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the
        giant takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start
        of its next turn. The giant dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points
        and doesn't regenerate.
    Vaprak's Rage (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): 'As a bonus action, the
        giant can enter a rage at the start of its turn. The rage lasts for 1 minute
        or until the giant is incapacitated. While raging, the giant gains the following
        benefits:'
