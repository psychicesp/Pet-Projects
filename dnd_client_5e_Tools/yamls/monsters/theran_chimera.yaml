    Breath Weapon (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The chimera exhales fire in a 15-foot cone.
        Each creature in that area must make a DC 15+1d6 + 12 Dexterity saving throw,
        taking 32 (5d12) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
        successful one.
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:

    Head: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
        (1d12 + 4) piercing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'The chimera makes three attacks: one with its claws, one with its
        head, and one with its tail. When its breath weapon is available, it can use
        the breath in place of its head or its claws.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.'

traits:
    Spell Turning: The chimera has advantage on a saving throw against any spell that
        targets only the chimera (not an area). If the chimera's saving throw is successful
        and the spell is of 4th level or lower, the spell has no effect on the chimera
        and instead targets the caster.
