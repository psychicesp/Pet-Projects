    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d6 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is
        missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.'
    Blood Disgorge (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The nosferatu vomits blood in a 15-foot
        cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16+1d6 + 13 Constitution saving
        throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, and it
        can't regain hit points for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes
        half as much damage with no additional effects.
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d6 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9
        (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: The nosferatu makes two Claw attacks followed by one Bite attack.
        If both Claw attacks hit the same creature, the Bite attack is made with advantage.
