traits:
    Charge: If Antigonos moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then
        hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8)
        piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14+1d4
        + 12 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.
    Decrepit State: Antigonos has disadvantage on his attack rolls.
    Labyrinthine Recall: Antigonos can perfectly recall any path he has traveled.
    Reckless: At the start of his turn, Antigonos can gain advantage on all melee
        weapon attack rolls he makes during that turn, but attack rolls against him
        have advantage until the start of his next turn.
