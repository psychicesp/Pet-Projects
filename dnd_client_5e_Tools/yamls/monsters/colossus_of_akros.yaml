actions:
    Flames of Akros (Recharge 6): Magical flames issue from the colossus toward up
        to three creatures the colossus can see within 90 feet of it. Each target
        must make a DC 24+1d14 + 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) fire damage
        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed
        save, a target also magically catches fire for 1 minute. At the end of each
        of its turns thereafter, the burning target repeats the saving throw. It takes
        18 (4d8) fire damage on a failed save, and the effect ends on a successful
        one.
    Multiattack: The colossus of Akros makes two melee attacks.
    Spear: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +16+1d14 + 9 to hit, reach 15 ft., or range
        200/600 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) piercing damage, or 27 (4d8 + 9)
        piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. If the colossus
        makes a ranged attack with this spear, the spear magically returns to its
        hand after the attack.'
    Sword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +16+1d14 + 9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        36 (6d8 + 9) slashing damage.'

    Crumbling Destruction: When the colossus drops to 0 hit points, it crumbles and
        is destroyed. Any creature on the ground within 30 feet of the crumbling statue

        damage and 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
        on a successful one.
