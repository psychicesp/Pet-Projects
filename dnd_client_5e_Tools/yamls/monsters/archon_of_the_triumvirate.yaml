    Hammer of Justice: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d10 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
        target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage. If
        the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Strength saving
        throw or be knocked prone.'
    Multiattack: The archon makes two Hammer of Justice attacks.
    Pacifying Presence: Each creature of the archon's choice that the archon can see
        within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Wisdom saving throw,
        or else the target drops any weapons it is holding, ends its concentration
        on any spells or other effects, and becomes charmed by the archon for 1 minute.
        The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
        turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw
        is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the archon's
        Pacifying Presence for the next 24 hours.

traits:
    Eye of the Law: As a bonus action, the archon can target a creature it can see
        within 120 feet of it and determine which laws that creature has broken in
        the last 24 hours.
    Mount: If the archon isn't mounted, it can use a bonus action to magically teleport
        onto the creature serving as its mount, provided the archon and its mount
        are on the same plane of existence. When it teleports, the archon appears
        astride the mount along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying. While
        mounted and not incapacitated, the archon can't be surprised, and both it
        and its mount gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws. If the archon is
        reduced to 0 hit points while riding its mount, the mount is reduced to 0
        hit points as well.
