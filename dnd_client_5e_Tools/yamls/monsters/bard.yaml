    Song of Rest: The bard can perform a song while taking a short rest. Any ally
        who hears the song regains an extra 1d6 hit points if it spends any Hit Dice
        to regain hit points at the end of that rest. The bard can confer this benefit
        on itself as well.
    Taunt (2/Day): The bard can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature
        within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed
        on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability
        checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next
        turn.
