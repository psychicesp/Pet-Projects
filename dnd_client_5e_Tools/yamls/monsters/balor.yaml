traits:
    Death Throes: When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet
        of it must make a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6)
        fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn
        or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.
    Fire Aura: At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet
        of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't
        being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it
        with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

        other magical effects.
