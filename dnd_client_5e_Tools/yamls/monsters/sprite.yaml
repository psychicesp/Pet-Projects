AC: 15
CR: 1/4 (50 XP)
HP: 2 (1d4)
actions:
    Heart Sight: The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's
        current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Charisma saving
        throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends,
        and undead automatically fail the saving throw.
    Invisibility: The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a
        spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any
        equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
    Longsword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +2+1d4 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        1 slashing damage.'
    Shortbow: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target.
        Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Constitution
        saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is
        5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or
        until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.'
