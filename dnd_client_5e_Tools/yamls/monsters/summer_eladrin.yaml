traits:
    Fearsome Presence: Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet
        of the eladrin must make a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
        save, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat
        the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
        on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends
        for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Fearsome Presence for the
        next 24 hours.
    Fey Step (Recharge 4xe2x80x936): As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up
        to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
    Magic Resistance: The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.
