AC: 12
CR: 1/2 (100 XP)
HP: 18 (4d8)
actions:
    Bite (Jackal or Hybrid Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach
        5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.'
    Scimitar (Human or Hybrid Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit,
        reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.'
    Sleep Gaze: The jackalwere gazes at one creature it can see within 30 feet of
        it. The target must make a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
        save, the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10
        minutes or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature
        that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwere's
        gaze for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't
        affected by it.
