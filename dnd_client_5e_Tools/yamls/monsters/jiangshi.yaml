actions:
    Change Shape: The jiangshi polymorphs into a Beast, a Humanoid, or an Undead that
        is Medium or Small or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than
        its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
        is absorbed or borne by the new form (the jiangshi's choice). It reverts to
        its true form if it dies.
    Consume Energy: 'The jiangshi draws energy from a creature it can see within 30
        feet of it. The target makes a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Constitution saving throw, taking
        18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one. The jiangshi regains hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage
        dealt. After regaining hit points from this action, the jiangshi gains the
        following benefits for 7 days: its walking speed increases to 40 feet, and
        it gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed and can hover.'
    Multiattack: The jiangshi makes three Slam attacks and uses Consume Energy.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d8 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
        (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.'
