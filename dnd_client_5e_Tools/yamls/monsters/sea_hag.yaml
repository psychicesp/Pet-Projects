    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.'
    Death Glare: The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet
        of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9
        Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.
    Illusory Appearance: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
        with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general
        size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to
        end it or if she dies.

    actions:
    - Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid
        walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.
    - The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each
        one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked
        (requiring a successful DC 20+1d4 + 18 Strength check to force open) until
        she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again
        to open them.
    - The hag fills up to four 10-foot cubes of water with ink. The inky areas are
        heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a steady, strong underwater current
        disperses the ink on initiative count 10. The hag ignores the obscuring effect
        of the ink.
    - The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum
        of that creature (as if created with the simulacrum spell). This hideous simulacrum
        is formed out of seaweed, slime, half-eaten fish, and other garbage, but still
        generally resembles the creature it is imitating. This simulacrum obeys the
        hag's commands and is destroyed on initiative count 20 on the next round.

traits:
    Amphibious: The hag can breathe air and water.
    Horrific Appearance: Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag
        and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Wisdom saving throw.
        On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can
        repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage
        if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.
