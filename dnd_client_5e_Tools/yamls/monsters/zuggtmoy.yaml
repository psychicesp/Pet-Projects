actions:
    Infestation Spores (3/Day): Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud
        that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute.
        Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters
        it later, must make a DC 19+1d14 + 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful
        save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed
        save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy
        and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness
        of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or
        dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it
        must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection
        on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over
        by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and
        is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see
        the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).
    Mind Control Spores (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst
        out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it
        lingers for 1 minute. Humanoids and beasts in the cloud when it appears, or
        that enter it later, must make a DC 19+1d14 + 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a
        successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours.
        On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the influence
        of Zuggtmoy for 24 hours. While infected in this way, the creature is charmed
        by her and can't be reinfected by these spores.

        Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.'
