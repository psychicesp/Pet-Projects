    Dreadful: Bael can use a bonus action to appear dreadful until the start of his
        next turn. Each creature, other than a devil, that starts its turn within
        10 feet of Bael must succeed on a DC 22+1d12 + 16 Wisdom saving throw or be
        frightened until the start of the creature's next turn.
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If Bael fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed
        instead.
    Magic Resistance: Bael has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
        magical effects.
    Magic Weapons: Bael's weapon attacks are magical.
    Regeneration: Bael regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes
        cold or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next
        turn. Bael dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
