        Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) slashing damage. If the target has at least one head and
        the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and

        Hit: 12 (1d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22+1d14
        + 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount
        equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes
        a long rest. The target transforms into a manes if this reduces its hit point
