    Summon Demon (1/Day): The drow magically summons a quasit, or attempts to summon
        a shadow demon with a 50 percent chance of success. The summoned demon appears
        in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of
        its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until
        it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
