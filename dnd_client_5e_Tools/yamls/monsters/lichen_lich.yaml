actions:
    Fire Storm (7th-Level Spell; 1/Day): The lich fills up to ten 10-foot cubes with
        fire. Every cube must be within 150 feet of the lich and occupy a space the
        lich can see, and each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face
        of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19+1d12 + 13 Dexterity
        saving throw, taking 38 (7d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area
        that aren't being worn or carried. If the lich chooses, plant life in the
        area is unaffected by the spell.
    Multiattack: The lich makes four attacks.
    Poisonous Touch: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d12 + 3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 17 (5d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19+1d12 +
        13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat
        the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
        on a success.'
    Spellcasting: 'The lich casts one of the following spells using Wisdom as the
        spellcasting ability (save DC 19+1d12 + 13):'
    Wither: 'Ranged Spell Attack: +9+1d12 + 3 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit:
        14 (4d6) necrotic damage.'

    actions:
    - Poisonous spores fill a 10-foot cube that the lich can see within 120 feet of
        it. Any creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts
        its turn there must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned
        until the end of its next turn. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until it is
        dispersed by a strong wind.
    - The lich commands the might of its diseased grove, creating a shambling mound.
        The shambling mound appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the lich,
        acts on its own initiative count, and obeys the lich's commands. The shambling
        mound dies after 1 hour or when the lich uses this lair action again.
    - Rotten roots and vines magically erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point
        on the ground that the lich can see within 120 feet of it. The lich is unaffected
        by the roots and vines. For all other creatures, the area becomes difficult
        terrain, and each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving
        throw or be restrained by the roots. As an action, a creature can try to free
        itself or another creature within its reach, doing so with a successful DC
        19 Strength (Athletics) check. The roots and vines wilt away when the lich
        uses this lair action again or when the lich dies.
