traits:
    Olhydra's Armor (Human Form Only): The fathomer can cast mage armor at will, without
        expending material components.
    Shapechanger (2/Day): The fathomer can use its action to polymorph into a Medium
        serpent composed of water, or back into its true form. Anything the fathomer
        is wearing or carrying is subsumed into the serpent form during the change,
        inaccessible until the fathomer returns to its true form. The fathomer reverts
        to its true form after 4 hours, unless it can expend another use of this trait.
        If the fathomer is knocked unconscious or dies, it also reverts to its true
        form.
