    Hypnotic Gaze: The ultroloth's eyes sparkle with opalescent light as it targets
        one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the ultroloth,
        the target must succeed on a DC 17+1d10 + 12 Wisdom saving throw against this
        magic or be charmed until the end of the ultroloth's next turn. The charmed
        target is stunned. If the target's saving throw is successful, the target
        is immune to the ultroloth's gaze for the next 24 hours.
