        21 (3d10 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed

        each attack it makes against Isperia before the start of her next turn.'

        time of 1 action in place of one claw attack.
    Supreme Legal Authority: 'Isperia chooses up to three creatures she can see within
        90 feet of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 23+1d14 + 16 Intelligence
        saving throw or Isperia chooses an action for that target: Attack, Cast a
        Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, or Use an Object.
        The affected target can''t take that action for 1 minute. At the end of each
        of the target''s turns, it can end the effect on itself with a successful
        DC 23+1d14 + 16 Intelligence saving throw. A target that succeeds on the saving
        throw becomes immune to Isperia''s Supreme Legal Authority for 24 hours.'
