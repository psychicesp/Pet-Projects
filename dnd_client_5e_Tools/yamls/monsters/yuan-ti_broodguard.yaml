    Mental Resistance: The broodguard has advantage on saving throws against being
        charmed, and magic can't paralyze it.
    Reckless: At the start of its turn, the broodguard can gain advantage on all melee
        weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it
        have advantage until the start of its next turn.
