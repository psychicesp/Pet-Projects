traits:
    Spectral Duplicate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): As a bonus action,
        the berbalang creates one spectral duplicate of itself in an unoccupied space
        it can see within 60 feet of it. While the duplicate exists, the berbalang
        is unconscious. A berbalang can have only one duplicate at a time. The duplicate
        disappears when it or the berbalang drops to 0 hit points or when the berbalang
        dismisses it (no action required).
