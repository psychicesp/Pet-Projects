traits:
    Howdah: The ogre carries a compact fort on its back. Up to four Small creatures
        can ride in the fort without squeezing. To make a melee attack against a target
        within 5 feet of the ogre, they must use spears or weapons with reach. Creatures
        in the fort have three-quarters cover against attacks and effects from outside
        it. If the ogre dies, creatures in the fort are placed in unoccupied spaces
        within 5 feet of the ogre.
