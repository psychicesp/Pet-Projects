    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8
        (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: The babau makes two melee attacks. It can also use Weakening Gaze
        before or after making these attacks.
    Spear: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range
        20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing

    Weakening Gaze: The babau targets one creature that it can see within 20 feet
