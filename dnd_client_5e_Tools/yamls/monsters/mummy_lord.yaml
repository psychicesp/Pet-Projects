    Dreadful Glare: The mummy lord targets one creature it can see within 60 feet
        of it. If the target can see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16+1d10
        + 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the
        end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or
        more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on
        the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy
        lords for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its
        rotting fist.
    Rotting Fist: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d10 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the
        target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16+1d10 + 11 Constitution saving
        throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can''t regain hit points,
        and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse.
        If the curse reduces the target''s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies,
        and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse
        spell or other magic.'

    - Each undead creature in the lair can pinpoint the location of each living creature
        within 120 feet of it until initiative count 20 on the next round.
    - Each undead in the lair has advantage on saving throws against effects that
        turn undead until initiative count 20 on the next round.
    - Until initiative count 20 on the next round, any non-undead creature that tries
        to cast a spell of 4th level or lower in the mummy lord's lair is wracked
        with pain. The creature can choose another action, but if it tries to cast
        the spell, it must make a DC 16+1d10 + 11 Constitution saving throw. On a
        failed save, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell, and the
        spell has no effect and is wasted.
