    Blazing Edict (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): Arcane energy emanates from the marut's
        chest in a 60-foot cube. Every creature in that area takes 45 radiant damage.
        Each creature that takes any of this damage must succeed on a DC 20+1d16 +
        12 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the marut's next turn.
    Justify: The marut targets up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it.
        Each target must succeed on a DC 20+1d16 + 12 Charisma saving throw or be
        teleported to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil.
        A target fails automatically if it is incapacitated. If either target is teleported
        in this way, the marut teleports with it to the circle.
    Multiattack: The marut makes two slam attacks.
    Unerring Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        60 force damage, and the target is pushed up to 5 feet away from the marut
        if it is Huge or smaller.'
