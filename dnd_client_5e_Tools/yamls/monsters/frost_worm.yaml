actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d12 + 9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the target is a
        Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Dexterity
        saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded
        and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside
        the worm, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and 10 (3d6) cold damage at the start
        of each of the worm''s turns.'
    Multiattack: The worm makes two bite attacks, or uses its Trill and makes a bite
        attack.
    Trill: The frost worm emits a haunting cry. Each creature within 60 feet of the
        worm that can hear it must succeed on a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Wisdom saving throw
        or be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw each time
        it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
        itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect,
        or if this effect ends for it, that creature is immune to the Trill of all
        frost worms for the next 24 hours. Frost worms are immune to this effect.

traits:
    Death Burst: When the worm dies, it explodes in a burst of frigid energy. Each
        creature within 60 feet of it must make a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Dexterity saving
        throw, taking 28 (8d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
        on a successful one. Creatures inside the worm when it dies automatically
        fail this saving throw.
    Freezing Body: A creature that touches the worm or hits it with a melee attack
        while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.
    Tunneler: The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and
