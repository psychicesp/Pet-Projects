CR: 1 (200 XP)
HP: 13 (3d4 + 6)
actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5
        (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.'
    Kiss: The vargouille kisses one incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. The
        target must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Charisma saving throw or become cursed.
        The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes
        on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight
        or the area of a daylight spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's
        Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes
        a new vargouille. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar
        spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse.
        Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.
    Stunning Shriek: The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and beast within 30 feet
        of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Wisdom
        saving throw or be frightened until the end of the vargouille's next turn.
        While frightened in this way, a target is stunned. If a target's saving throw
        is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning
        Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.
