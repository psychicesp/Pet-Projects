    actions:
    - Orcus's voice booms throughout the lair. His utterance causes one creature of
        his choice to be subjected to power word kill. Orcus needn't see the creature,
        but he must be aware that the individual is in the lair.
    - Orcus causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as skeletons, zombies,
        or ghouls. These undead obey his telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere
        in the lair.
    - Orcus causes skeletal arms to rise from an area on the ground in a 20-foot square
        that he can see. They last until the next initiative count 20. Each creature
        in that area when the arms appear must succeed on a DC 23+1d16 + 15 Strength
        saving throw or be restrained until the arms disappear or until Orcus releases
        their grasp (no action required).

            he can see within 100 feet of him. A cylinder of swirling necrotic energy
            60 feet tall and with a 10-foot radius rises from that point and lasts
            until the end of Orcus''s next turn. Creatures in that area have vulnerability
            to necrotic damage.'

    Master of Undeath: When Orcus casts animate dead or create undead, he chooses
        the level at which the spell is cast, and the creatures created by the spells
        remain under his control indefinitely. Additionally, he can cast create undead
        even when it isn't night.
    Wand of Orcus: 'The wand has 7 charges, and any of its properties that require
        a saving throw have a save DC of 18. While holding it, Orcus can use an action
        to cast animate dead, blight, or speak with dead. Alternatively, he can expend
        1 or more of the wand''s charges to cast one of the following spells from
        it: circle of death (1 charge), finger of death (1 charge), or power word
        kill (2 charges). The wand regains 1d4 + 3 charges daily at dawn.'
