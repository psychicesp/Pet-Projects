actions:
    "Acid Breath (Recharge 5\u20136)": The dragon exhales acid in a 90-foot line that
        is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22+1d14 + 15 Dexterity
        saving throw, taking 67 (15d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one.
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.'
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.'
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet
        of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19+1d14 + 12 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks:
        one with its bite and two with its claws.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.'

    actions:
    - Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in
        a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool
        must succeed on a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to
        20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
    - A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point
        the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners
        and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action
        again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when
        it appears must make on a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Constitution saving throw, taking
        10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
    - Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it,
        filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action,
        uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners.
        A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical
        light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area
        of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created
        the light is dispelled.

            saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
            The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.'
