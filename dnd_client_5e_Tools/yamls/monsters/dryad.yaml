    Fey Charm: The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30
        feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14+1d4
        + 12 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards
        the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target
        isn't under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions
        in the most favorable way it can.
