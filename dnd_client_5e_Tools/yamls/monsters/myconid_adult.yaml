    Fist: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +2+1d4 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5
        (2d4) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.'
    Pacifying Spores (3/Day): The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see
        within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Constitution
        saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Rapport Spores: A 20-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores
        can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2
        or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures
        can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet
        of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
