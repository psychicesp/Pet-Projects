actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d12 + 7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage.'
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d12 + 7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
        with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.'
    Steam Breath (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam
        in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18+1d12 + 12
        Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save,
        or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant
        resistance against this damage.
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d12 + 7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
        on a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away
        from the dragon turtle and knocked prone.'
