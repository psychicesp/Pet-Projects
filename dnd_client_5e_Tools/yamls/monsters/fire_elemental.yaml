traits:
    Fire Form: The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without
        squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack
        while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the elemental
        can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters
        a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and
        catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature
        takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
    Illumination: The elemental sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light
        in an additional 30 feet.
    Water Susceptibility: For every 5 feet the elemental moves in water, or for every
        gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.
