actions:
    Chilling Gaze: The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it.
        If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11
        Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) cold damage
        and then be paralyzed for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The
        target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
        the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful,
        or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Chilling Gaze of
        all yetis (but not abominable yetis) for 1 hour.
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
        (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.'
    Multiattack: The yeti can use its Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.
