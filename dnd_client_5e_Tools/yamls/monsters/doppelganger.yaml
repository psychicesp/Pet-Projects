AC: 14
CR: 3 (700 XP)
HP: 52 (8d8 + 16)
actions:
    Multiattack: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.
    Read Thoughts: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature
        within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood
        or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks
        it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its
        thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if
        concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger
        has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and
        Persuasion) checks against the target.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
        (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.'

traits:
    Ambusher: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack
        rolls against any creature it surprised.
    Shapechanger: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or
        Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other
        than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
        isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
    Surprise Attack: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an
        attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6)
        damage from the attack.
