    Dreadful Glare: The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it.
        If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Wisdom
        saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the
        mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is
        also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving
        throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords)
        for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its
        rotting fist.
    Rotting Fist: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the
        target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving
        throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can''t regain hit points,
        and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse.
        If the curse reduces the target''s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies,
        and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse
        spell or other magic.'
