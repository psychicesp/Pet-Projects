    Blood Drain: One creature grappled by a tentacle of the death kiss must make a
        DC 16+1d8 + 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
        22 (4d10) lightning damage, and the death kiss regains half as many hit points.
    Multiattack: The death kiss makes three tentacle attacks. Up to three of these
        attacks can be replaced by Blood Drain, one replacement per tentacle grappling
        a creature
    Tentacle: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d8 + 4 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        14 (3d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14+1d8
        + 10) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target
        is restrained, and the death kiss can''t use the same tentacle on another
        target. The death kiss has ten tentacles.'
