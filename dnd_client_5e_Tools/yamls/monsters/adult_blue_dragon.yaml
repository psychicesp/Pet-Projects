        of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17+1d10 + 12 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

        throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried.

        state on a success.

        the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners.
        Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15+1d10 + 10 Constitution
        saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
