AC: 14
CR: 9 (5,000 XP)
HP: 157 (21d8 + 63)
actions:
    Greatsword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d8 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage, and the target
        must succeed on a DC 12+1d8 + 8 Constitution saving throw or contract bluerot
        (see the "Bluerot" in notes).'
    Life-Draining Tentacle: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d8 + 3 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
        one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on
        a DC 15+1d8 + 11 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced
        by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces
        its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction lasts until the target finishes
        a long rest. On a failed save, the target also contracts bluerot (see the
        "Bluerot" in notes).'
    Multiattack: 'The drowned master makes two attacks: one with its greatsword and
        one with its Life-Draining Tentacle.'
    Necrotic Ink (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The drowned master discharges foul ink in
        front of itself in a 30-foot cone. Each creature caught in the ink must make
        a DC 15+1d8 + 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) necrotic damage
        on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that
        fails this saving throw is blinded until the end of its next turn and contracts
        bluerot (see the "Bluerot" in notes).

traits:
    Bound Together: The drowned master shares its mind with every other drowned one
        within 1 mile of it, and can communicate its thoughts and observations to
        them instantaneously and without limitation.
    Cold Aura: At the start of each of the drowned master's turns, each creature within
        5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) cold damage. A creature that touches the drowned
        master or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10)
        cold damage.
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces the drowned master to 0 hit points, it must
        make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless
        the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the drowned master
        drops to 1 hit point instead.
