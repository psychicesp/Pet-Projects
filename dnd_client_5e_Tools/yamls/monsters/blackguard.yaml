    Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The blackguard exudes
        magical menace. Each enemy within 30 feet of the blackguard must succeed on
        a DC 13+1d6 + 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If a frightened
        target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the blackguard, the target
        can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Glaive: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: The blackguard makes three attacks with its glaive or its shortbow.
    Shortbow: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +3+1d6 + 0 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target.
        Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.'
