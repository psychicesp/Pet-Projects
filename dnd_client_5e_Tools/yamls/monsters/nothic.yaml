        (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: The nothic makes two claw attacks.
    Rotting Gaze: The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it.
        The target must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw against
        this magic or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
    Weird Insight: The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it.
        The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the nothic's
        Wisdom (Insight) check. If the nothic wins, it magically learns one fact or
        secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to
