    Acid Spray (Recharge 6): The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long
        and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature
        in that line must make a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10
        (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
        (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large
        or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13+1d4 + 11). Until this grapple
        ends, the ankheg can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on
        attack rolls to do so.'
