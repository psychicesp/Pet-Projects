    actions:
    - The giant creates a thunderclap centered on a point anywhere in its lair. Each
        creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Constitution
        saving throw or be deafened until the end of its next turn.
    - The giant creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog (or murky water within water)
        centered on a point anywhere in its lair. The sphere spreads around corners,
        and its area is heavily obscured. The fog lasts until the giant disperses
        it (no action required), and it can't be dispersed by wind.
    - The giant creates a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line of strong wind ( or strong
        current within water) originating from a point anywhere in its lair. Each
        creature in that line must succeed on a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Strength saving throw
        or be pushed 15 feet in the direction the wind is blowing. The gust disperses
        gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected
        flames in its area. Protected flames, such as those of lanterns, have a 50
        percent chance of being extinguished.

    options:
        Gust: ' The giant targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates
            a magical gust of wind around it. The target must succeed on a DC 18+1d10
            + 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in any horizontal
            direction the giant chooses.'
        One with the Storm (3 Actions): ' The giant vanishes, dispersing itself into
            the storm surrounding its lair. The giant can end this effect at the start
            of any of its turns, becoming a giant once more and appearing in any location
            it chooses within its lair. While dispersed, the giant can''t take any
            actions other than lair actions, and it can''t be targeted by attacks,
            spells, or other effects. The giant can''t use this ability outside its
            lair, nor can it use this ability if another creature is using a control
            weather spell or similar magic to quell the storm.'
        Thunderbolt (2 Actions): ' The giant hurls a thunderbolt at a creature it
            can see within 600 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18+1d10 + 13
            Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) thunder damage on a failed save,
            or half as much damage on a successful one.'
