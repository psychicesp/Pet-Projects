traits:
    Incorporeal Movement: The troll can move through other creatures and objects as
        if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends
        its turn inside an object.
    Regeneration: The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns.
        If the troll takes psychic or force damage, this trait doesn't function at

        with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
