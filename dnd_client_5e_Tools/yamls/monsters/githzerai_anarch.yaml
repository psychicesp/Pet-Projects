    actions:
    - The anarch casts the lightning bolt spell (at 5th level), but the anarch can
        change the damage type from lightning to cold, fire, psychic, radiant, or
        thunder. If the spell deals damage other than fire or lightning, it doesn't
        ignite flammable objects.
    - The anarch casts the creation spell (as a 9th-level spell) using the unformed
        substance of Limbo instead of shadow material. If used in Limbo, the object
        remains until the anarch's concentration is broken, regardless of its composition.
        If the anarch moves more than 120 feet from the object, its concentration
        breaks.
    - 'The anarch can magically move an object it can see within 150 feet of it by
        making a Wisdom check with advantage. The DC depends on the object''s size:
        DC 5+1d10 + 0 for Tiny, DC 10+1d10 + 5 for Small, DC 15+1d10 + 10 for Medium,
        DC 20+1d10 + 15 for Large, and DC 25+1d10 + 20 for Huge or larger.'
