    Amorphous: The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without
        squeezing.
    Corrode Metal: Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes.
        After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative xe2x88x921
        penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to xe2x88x925, the weapon is
        destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed
        after dealing damage.
    False Appearance: While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from
        an oily pool or wet rock.
