CR: 15 (13,000 XP)
HP: 144 (17d8 + 68)
actions:
    Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d10 + 4 to hit, reach
        5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire,
        incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6)
        necrotic damage. The target''s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal
        to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to
        that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The
        target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid
        slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night
        as a vampire spawn under the vampire''s control.'
    Charm: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the
        target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17+1d10 + 12 Wisdom
        saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed
        target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected.
        Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's
        requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing
        target for the vampire's bite attack.
    Children of the Night (1/Day): The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats
        or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call
        3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies
        of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour,
        until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.
    Greatsword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d10 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: The vampire makes two greatsword attacks.
    Multiattack (Vampire Form Only): The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which
        can be a bite attack.
    Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d10 + 4 to hit,
        reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of
        dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18+1d10 + 13).'

traits:
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose
        to succeed instead.
    Misty Escape: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire
        transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of
        falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water.
        If it can't transform, it is destroyed.
    Regeneration: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it
        has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire
        takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function
        at the start of the vampire's next turn.
    Shapechanger: If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its
        action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into
        its true form.
    Spider Climb: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down
        on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
