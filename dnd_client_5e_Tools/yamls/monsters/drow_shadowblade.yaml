    Hand Crossbow: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +9+1d8 + 5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one
        target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a
        DC 13+1d8 + 9 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the
        saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned
        in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another
        creature takes an action to shake it.'
    Multiattack: The drow makes two attacks with its shadow sword. If either attack
        hits and the target is within 10 feet of a 5-foot cube of darkness created
        by the shadow sword on a previous turn, the drow can dismiss that darkness
        and cause the target to take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The drow can dismiss
        darkness in this way no more than once per turn.
    Shadow Sword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d8 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and 10 (3d6)
        poison damage. The drow can then fill an unoccupied 5-foot cube within 5 feet
        of the target with magical darkness, which remains for 1 minute.'

    Fey Ancestry: The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and
        magic can't put the drow to sleep.

        action up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is also in dim
        light or darkness. It then has advantage on the first melee attack it makes
        before the end of the turn.
    Sunlight Sensitivity: While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls,
        as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
