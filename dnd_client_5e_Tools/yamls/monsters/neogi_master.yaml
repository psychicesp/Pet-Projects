actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6
        (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must
        succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for
        1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
        ending the effect on itself on a success.'
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.'
    Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The neogi targets one creature
        it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14+1d4 +
        12 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the neogi for 1 day, or
        until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The charmed target
        obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the
        target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up
        to 1 mile. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving
        throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Multiattack: 'The neogi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its
        claws.'
