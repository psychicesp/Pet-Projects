actions:
    Idyllic Touch: 'Melee Spell Attack: +8+1d8 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
        on a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone in a fit of laughter.'
    Mind Thrust: The quori targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The
        target must make a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) psychic
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    Multiattack: The quori uses its Mind Thrust twice.
    Possession (Recharge 6): One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of
        it must succeed on a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Charisma saving throw or be possessed
        by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and
        loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive
        the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell,
        or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
        and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed
        target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class
        features, or proficiencies.
