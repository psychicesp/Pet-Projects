traits:
    Bond of the Black Earth: The burrowshark is magically bound to a bulette trained
        to serve as its mount. While mounted on its bulette, the burrowshark shares
        the bulette's senses and can ride the bulette while it burrows. The bonded
        bulette obeys the burrowshark's commands. If its mount dies, the burrowshark
        can train a new bulette to serve as its bonded mount, a process requiring
        a month.
