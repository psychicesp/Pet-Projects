traits:
    Charge: If the moose moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then
        hits it with an antlers attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra
        9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on
        a DC 14+1d4 + 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
    Sure-Footed: The moose has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made
        against effects that would knock it prone.
