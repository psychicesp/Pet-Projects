actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5
        (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage in crocodile form.
        If the lizardfolk is in crocodile form and the target is a Large or smaller
        creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 12+1d4 + 10). Until this grapple
        ends, the target is restrained, and the lizardfolk can''t bite another target.
        If the lizardfolk reverts to its true form, the grapple ends.'
    Change Shape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The lizardfolk magically
        polymorphs into a crocodile, remaining in that form for up to 1 hour. It can
        revert to its true form as a bonus action. Its statistics, other than its
        size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't
        transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
    Claws (Lizardfolk Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5
        ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack (Lizardfolk Form Only): 'The lizardfolk makes two attacks: one with
        its bite and one with its claws.'
