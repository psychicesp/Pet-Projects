actions:
    Lashing Maw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +14+1d14 + 7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
        Hit: 20 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) acid damage.'
    Multiattack: The emissary makes three attacks.
    Psychic Orb: 'Ranged Spell Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) psychic damage.'
    Unearthly Bile (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The emissary expels bile that splashes
        all creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet
        of the emissary. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23+1d14 + 16 Dexterity
        saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. For each creature that fails the saving throw,
        a gibbering mouther (see its entry in the Monster Manual) appears in an unoccupied
        space on a surface that can support it within 30 feet of that creature. The
        gibbering mouthers act right after the emissary on the same initiative count,
        gaining a +7 bonus to their attack and damage rolls, and fighting until they
        are destroyed. They disappear when the emissary dies.
