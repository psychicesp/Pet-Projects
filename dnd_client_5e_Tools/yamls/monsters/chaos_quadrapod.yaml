    Chaos Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The chaos quadrapod shoots
        forth a knot of roiling ethereal light that explodes at a point it can see
        within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on
        that point must succeed on a DC 14+1d4 + 12 Charisma saving throw or be stunned
        until the end of its next turn.
    Multiattack: The chaos quadrapod makes up to two tentacle attacks.
    Tentacle: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled
        (escape DC 14+1d4 + 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.
        The chaos quadrapod can grapple no more than two targets at a time.'
