actions:
    Deluge (Recharge 4xe2x80x936): Zegana conjures a wave of water that crashes down
        on an area within 120 feet of her. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up
        to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make
        a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
        18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a
        creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. The water spreads
        out across the ground, extinguishing unprotected flames it comes in contact
        with, and then vanishes.
    Prime Speaker's Trident: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10+1d10 + 5 to hit,
        reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage,
        and the trident emits a thunderous boom. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating
        from the prongs of the trident must make a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Constitution saving
        throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is
        pushed 10 feet away from Zegana. If the creature is underwater, the damage
        is increased to 13 (3d8). On a successful save, the creature takes half as
        much damage and isn''t pushed.'
