traits:
    Fire Banishment: When the barghest starts its turn engulfed in flames that are
        at least 10 feet high or wide, it must succeed on a DC 15+1d4 + 13 Charisma
        saving throw or be instantly banished to Gehenna. Instantaneous bursts of
        flame (such as a red dragon's breath or a fireball spell) don't have this
        effect on the barghest.
    Keen Smell: The barghest has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely
        on smell.
    Shapechanger: The barghest can use its action to polymorph into a Small goblin
        or back into its true form. Other than its size and speed, its statistics
        are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
        The barghest reverts to its true form if it dies.
    Soul Feeding: A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that
        has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both flesh and soul in doing
        so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victim's body.
        The victim's soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time
        it is digested. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul
        is released.
