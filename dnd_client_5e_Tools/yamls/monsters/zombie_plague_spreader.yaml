AC: 10
CR: 4 (1,100 XP)
HP: 78 (12d8 + 24)
actions:
    Multiattack: The plague spreader makes two Slam attacks.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6
        (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.'
    Virulent Miasma (1/Day): The plague spreader releases toxic gas in a 30-foot-radius
        sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12+1d4
        + 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed
        save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid reduced to 0
        hit points by this damage dies and rises as a zombie (see its stat block in
        the Monster Manual) 1 minute later. The zombie acts immediately after the
        plague spreader in the initiative count.

traits:
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a
        Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage
        is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit
        point instead.
    Unusual Nature: The zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
    Viral Aura: Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the plague spreader
        must make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
        creature is poisoned and can't regain hit points until the end of its next
        turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this plague spreader's
        Viral Aura for 24 hours.
