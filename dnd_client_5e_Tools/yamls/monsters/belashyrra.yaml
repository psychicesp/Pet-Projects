    actions:
    - An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of Belashyrra. One random eye
        ray of Belashyrra's shoots from that eye at a target of Belashyrra's choice
        that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.
    - Belashyrra creates a wave of madness. Each creature it can see within its lair
        must succeed on a DC 22+1d14 + 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1
        minute. While charmed in this way, a creature must use its action at the start
        of its turn before moving to make a melee attack against another creature
        of Belashyrra's choice within reach. If there are no creatures within reach,
        the charmed creature can act normally for that turn. A charmed creature can
        repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
        on itself on a success.
    - Belashyrra taps into the eyesight of creatures in its lair and alters their
        perception. Each creature of Belashyrra's choice in the lair must make a DC
        22+1d14 + 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the affected creature perceives
        objects and creatures a short distance from their actual locations, imposing
        disadvantage on the creature's attack rolls against those targets. An affected
        creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
        the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful
        or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this lair action for
        the next 24 hours.

traits:
    Alien Mind: If a creature tries to read Belashyrra's thoughts or deals psychic
        damage to it, that creature must succeed on a DC 22+1d14 + 15 Intelligence
        saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The stunned creature can repeat the

    Eye Thief: Belashyrra can see through the eyes of all creatures within 120 feet

        to succeed instead.
    Magic Resistance: Belashyrra has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.

        regenerate.

        space it can see.
