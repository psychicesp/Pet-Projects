traits:
    Arcane Advantage: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage
        to a creature it hits with a damaging spell attack if that target is within
        5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin and that ally isn't incapacitated.
    Army Arcana: When the hobgoblin casts a spell that causes damage or that forces
        other creatures to make a saving throw, it can choose itself and any number
        of allies to be immune to the damage caused by the spell and to succeed on
        the required saving throw.
