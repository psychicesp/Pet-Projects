    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8

    Fire Burst (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The giant strider hurls a gout of flame at
        a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius
        sphere centered on that point must make a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Dexterity saving
        throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
        on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners, and it ignites flammable
        objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried.
