    actions:
    - Yeenoghu causes an iron spike - 5 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter - to burst
        from the ground at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Any creature
        in the space where the spike emerges must make a DC 24+1d14 + 17 Dexterity
        saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) piercing damage
        and is restrained by being impaled on the spike. A creature can use an action
        to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the restrained
        condition.
    - Each gnoll or hyena that Yeenoghu can see can use its reaction to move up to
        its speed.
    - Until the next initiative count 20, all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are
        enraged, causing them to have advantage on melee weapon attack rolls and causing
        attack rolls to have advantage against them.

            must succeed on a DC 24+1d14 + 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15
            feet in a straight line away from Yeenoghu. If the saving throw fails
            by 5 or more, the target falls prone.'
