    actions:
    - Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid
        walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.
    - The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each
        one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked
        (requiring a successful DC 20+1d6 + 17 Strength check to force open) until
        she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again
        to open them.
    - The hag creates a thick cloud of caustic black smoke that fills a 20-foot-radius
        sphere centered on a point she can see within 120 feet her. The cloud lasts
        until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures and objects in or behind
        the smoke are heavily obscured. A creature that enters the cloud for the first
        time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.
