    - The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll
        initiative. The sphinx can choose not to reroll.
    - The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed
        on a DC 15+1d12 + 9 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years older or
        younger (the sphinx's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A greater
        restoration spell can restore a creature's age to normal.
    - The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything within moves
        up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx's choice). Only the sphinx is immediately
        aware of the time change. A wish spell can return the caster and up to seven
        other creatures designated by the caster to their normal time.
    - The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see within in
        its lair to another plane of existence. Once outside its lair, the sphinx
        can't use lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a bonus action on
        its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it.
