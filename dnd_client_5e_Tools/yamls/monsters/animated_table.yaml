traits:
    Antimagic Susceptibility: The table is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic
        field. If targeted by dispel magic, the table must succeed on a Constitution
        saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1
        minute.
    Charge: If the table moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then
        hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8)
        bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15+1d4
        + 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
    False Appearance: While the table remains motionless, it is indistinguishable
        from a normal table.
