    Body Thief: The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated
        humanoid within 5 feet of it that isn't protected by protection from evil
        and good. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes
        the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of
        the target's body. While inside a creature, the intellect devourer has total
        cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The
        intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores,
        as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits.
        It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature
        knew, including spells and languages.
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +4+1d4 + 2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.'
    Devour Intellect: 'The intellect devourer targets one creature it can see within
        10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10
        Intelligence saving throw against this magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage.
        Also on a failure, roll 3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target''s
        Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until
        it regains at least one point of Intelligence.'
    Multiattack: The intellect devourer makes one attack with its claws and uses Devour
        Intellect.
