traits:
    Mimicry: The wereraven can mimic simple sounds it has heard, such as a person
        whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A creature that hears
        the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10+1d4 + 8 Wisdom
        (Insight) check.
    Regeneration: The wereraven regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If
        the wereraven takes damage from a silvered weapon or a spell, this trait doesn't
        function at the start of the wereraven's next turn. The wereraven dies only
        if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
    Shapechanger: The wereraven can use its action to polymorph into a raven-humanoid
        hybrid or into a raven, or back into its human form. Its statistics, other
        than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
        isn't transformed. It reverts to its human form if it dies.
