    Multiattack: The githyanki makes two silver greatsword attacks.
    Silver Greatsword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d6 + 6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This is a
        magic weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body
        (as with the astral projection spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord
        that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.'
