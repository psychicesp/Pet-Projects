    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d6 + 6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19
        (3d8 + 6) piercing damage.'
    Branch: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d6 + 6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.'
    Grasping Root: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d6 + 6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature
        not grappled by the blight. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15+1d6
        + 12). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 9 (1d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage
        at the start of each of its turns. The root has AC 15 and can be severed by
        dealing 6 slashing damage or more to it at once. Cutting the root doesn''t
        hurt the blight, but ends the grapple.'

        its grasping roots. If it has a target grappled, the blight can also make
        a bite attack against that target as a bonus action.'
