actions:
    Animate Trees (1/Day): The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see
        within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except
        they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they
        have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the
        treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant
        dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus
        action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if
        possible.
    Multiattack: The treant makes two slam attacks.
    Rock: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target.
        Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.'
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.'
