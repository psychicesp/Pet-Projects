    actions:
    - The illithilich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower.
        If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.
    - The illithilich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling
        cord of negative energy tethers the illithilich to the target. Whenever the
        illithilich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18+1d14 + 11 Constitution
        saving throw. On a failed save, the illithilich takes half the damage (rounded
        down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until
        initiative count 20 on the next round or until the illithilich or the target
        is no longer in the illithilich's lair.
    - The illithilich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair.
        These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the illithilich
        can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18+1d14 + 11
        Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save,
        or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.
