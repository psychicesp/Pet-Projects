actions:
    Captivating Presence (Recharge 6): Each creature within 120 feet of the master
        must succeed on a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the
        master for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, a creature's speed is 0. If
        the charmed creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending
        the effect on itself on a success. A target that succeeds on the saving throw
        is immune to the Captivating Presence of all masters of cruelties for the
        next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: The master makes two melee attacks with its spear.
    Spear: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8+1d8 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range
        20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4)
        piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 13 (3d8)
        psychic damage.'

        or it must immediately take the Attack action, making one melee attack against
        a random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, it makes
        a ranged attack against a random creature within range, throwing its weapon
        if necessary.
    Feed on the Crowd: Whenever a creature within 60 feet of the master dies, the
