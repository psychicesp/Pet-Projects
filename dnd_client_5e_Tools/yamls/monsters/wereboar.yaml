traits:
    Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only): If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight
        toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target
        takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must
        succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
    Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): If the wereboar takes 14 damage
        or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point
        instead.
    Shapechanger: The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a boar-humanoid
        hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its
        statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it
        is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it
        dies.
