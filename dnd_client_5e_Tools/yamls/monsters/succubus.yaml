actions:
    Charm: One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC
        15+1d4 + 13 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed
        target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers
        any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending
        the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect,
        or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's Charm for
        the next 24 hours.
    Claw (Fiend Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
        one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.'
    Draining Kiss: The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature.
        The target must make a DC 15+1d4 + 13 Constitution saving throw against this
        magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an
        amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes
        a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum
        to 0.
    Etherealness: The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material
        Plane, or vice versa.

traits:
    Shapechanger: The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium
        humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its flying
        speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each
        form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts
        to its true form if it dies.
    Telepathic Bond: The fiend ignores the range restriction on its telepathy when
        communicating with a creature it has charmed. The two don't even need to be
        on the same plane of existence.
