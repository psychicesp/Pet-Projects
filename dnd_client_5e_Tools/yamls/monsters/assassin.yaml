traits:
    Assassinate: During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls
        against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores
        against a surprised creature is a critical hit.
    Evasion: If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity
        saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage
        if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
    Sneak Attack (1/Turn): The assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits
        a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when
        the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated
        and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
