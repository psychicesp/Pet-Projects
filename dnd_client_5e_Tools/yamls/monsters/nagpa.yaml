traits:
    Corruption: As a bonus action, the nagpa targets one creature it can see within
        90 feet of it. The target must make a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Charisma saving throw.
        An evil creature makes the save with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target
        is charmed by the nagpa until the start of the nagpa's next turn. On a successful
        save, the target becomes immune to the nagpa's Corruption for the next 24
        hours.
    Paralysis (Recharge 6): As a bonus action, the nagpa forces each creature within
        30 feet of it to succeed on a DC 20+1d12 + 14 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed
        for 1 minute. A paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
        each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Undead and constructs
        are immune to this effect.
