AC: 15
CR: 5 (1,800 XP)
HP: 136 (16d10 + 48)
actions:
    Engulf: The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it.
        The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it
        must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Constitution saving throw at the start of
        each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the
        mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one
        creature engulfed at a time.
    Multiattack: The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a
        Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14+1d6 + 11),
        and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
        (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.'
