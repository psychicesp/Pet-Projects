actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +17+1d14 + 10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.'

    "Fire Breath (Recharge 5\u20136)": The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone.
        Each creature in that area must make a DC 24+1d14 + 17 Dexterity saving throw,
        taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
        successful one.
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet
        of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks:
        one with its bite and two with its claws.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +17+1d14 + 10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.'

    actions:
    - Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of
        it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's
        area must make a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    - A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature
        other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15+1d14
        + 8 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
    - Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the
        dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and
        its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next
        round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC
        13+1d14 + 6 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its
        turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.
