traits:
    Ash Puff: The first time the zombie takes damage, any living creature within 5
        feet of the zombie must succeed on a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Constitution saving throw
        or gain disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for
        1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
        turns, ending the effect on it early with a successful save.
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a
        Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage
        is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit
        point instead.
