actions:
    Animating Spores (3/Day): The myconid targets one corpse of a humanoid or a Large
        or smaller beast within 5 feet of it and releases spores at the corpse. In
        24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant. The corpse stays animated for
        1d4 + 1 weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.
    Fist: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +3+1d4 + 1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8
        (3d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) poison damage.'
    Hallucination Spores: The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within
        5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving
        throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is incapacitated while
        it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
        of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Multiattack: The myconid uses either its Hallucination Spores or its Pacifying
        Spores, then makes a fist attack.
    Pacifying Spores: The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within
        5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12+1d4 + 10 Constitution saving
        throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Rapport Spores: A 30-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores
        can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2
        or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures
        can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet
        of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
