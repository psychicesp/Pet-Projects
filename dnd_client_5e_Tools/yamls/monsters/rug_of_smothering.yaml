traits:
    Antimagic Susceptibility: The rug is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic
        field. If targeted by dispel magic, the rug must succeed on a Constitution
        saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1
        minute.
    Damage Transfer: While it is grappling a creature, the rug takes only half the
        damage dealt to it, and the creature grappled by the rug takes the other half.
    False Appearance: While the rug remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from
        a normal rug.
