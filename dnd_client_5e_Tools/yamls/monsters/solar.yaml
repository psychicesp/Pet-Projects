    Flying Sword: The solar releases its greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied
        space within 5 feet of it. If the solar can see the sword, the solar can mentally
        command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack
        against a target or return to the solar's hands. If the hovering sword is
        targeted by any effect, the solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering
        sword falls if the solar dies.
    Greatsword: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage.'
    Healing Touch (4/Day): The solar touches another creature. The target magically
        regains 40 (8d8 + 4) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison,
        blindness, or deafness.
    Multiattack: The solar makes two greatsword attacks.
    Slaying Longbow: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +13+1d14 + 6 to hit, range 150/600 ft.,
        one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage.
        If the target is a creature that has 100 hit points or fewer, it must succeed
        on a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Constitution saving throw or die.'
