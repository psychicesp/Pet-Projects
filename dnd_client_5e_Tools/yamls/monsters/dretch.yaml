AC: 11
CR: 1/4 (50 XP)
HP: 18 (4d6 + 4)
actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +2+1d4 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3
        (1d6) piercing damage.'
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +2+1d4 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        5 (2d4) slashing damage.'
    Fetid Cloud (1/Day): A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from
        the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured.
        It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that
        starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Constitution
        saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned
        in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its
        turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
    Multiattack: 'The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its
        claws.'
