    Shadow Breath (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The dragon exhales shadowy fire in a 30-foot
        cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18+1d10 + 13 Dexterity saving
        throw, taking 56 (16d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage
        dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after
        the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon's control.
