actions:
    Crush: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target.
        If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the
        attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target''s head, and the target is
        also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this
        way.'
    Darkness Aura (1/Day): A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the
        darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts
        as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if
        concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no
        natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area
        of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the
        light is dispelled.
