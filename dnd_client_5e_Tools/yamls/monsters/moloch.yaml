actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage.'
    Breath of Despair (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): Moloch exhales in a 30-foot cube. Each
        creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21+1d14 + 14 Wisdom saving throw
        or take 27 (5d10) psychic damage, drop whatever it is holding, and become
        frightened for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature must take
        the Dash action and move away from Moloch by the safest available route on
        each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't
        take the Dash action. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it
        doesn't have line of sight to Moloch, the creature can repeat the saving throw.
        On a success, the effect ends.

        target. Hit: 13 (2d4 + 8) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.
        If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 24+1d14 + 17 Strength
        saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet in a straight line toward Moloch.'
    Multiattack: 'Moloch makes three attacks: one with his bite, one with his claw,
        and one with his whip.'
    Teleport: Moloch magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and
        carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
