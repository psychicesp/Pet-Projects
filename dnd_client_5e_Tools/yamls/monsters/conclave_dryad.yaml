AC: 16
CR: 9 (5,000 XP)
HP: 143 (22d8 + 44)
actions:
    Longbow: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +8+1d8 + 4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target.
        Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.'
    Multiattack: The dryad makes three attacks, using its vine staff, its longbow,
        or both.
    Summon Mount (1/Day): 'The dryad magically summons a mount, which appears in an
        unoccupied space within 60 feet of the dryad. The mount remains for 8 hours,
        until it or the dryad dies, or until the dryad dismisses it as an action.
        The mount uses the stat block of an elk (see the Monster Manual) with these
        changes: it is a plant instead of a beast, it has an Intelligence of 6, and
        it understands Sylvan but can''t speak. While within 1 mile of the mount,
        the dryad can communicate with it telepathically.'
    Suppress Magic (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The dryad targets one magic item it can
        see within 120 feet of it. If the magic item isn't an artifact, its magical
        properties are suppressed for 10 minutes, until the dryad is incapacitated
        or dies, or until the dryad uses a bonus action to end the effect.
    Vine Staff: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d8 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
        succeed on a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by
        twisting vines for 1 minute. A target restrained in this way can use an action
        to make a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check,
        ending the effect on itself on a success.'
