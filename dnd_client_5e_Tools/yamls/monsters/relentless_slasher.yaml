actions:
    Multiattack: The slasher makes two Slasher's Knife attacks.
    Slasher's Knife: 'Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft.
        or range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6)
        necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it suffers a lingering wound
        that causes it to take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its
        turns. Each time the slasher hits the wounded target with this attack, the
        damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 (1d6). The wound ends if the target
        regains hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which
        requires a successful DC 15+1d6 + 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check.'
