traits:
    Aura of Mind Erosion: Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the
        sire must make a DC 18+1d8 + 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save,
        the creature is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours. On a failed save,
        the creature has disadvantage for 1 minute on Wisdom and Charisma checks and
        on Wisdom and Charisma saves. At the start of each of its turns, the sire
        can suppress this aura until the start of its next turn.
    Magic Resistance: The sire has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
        magical effects.
