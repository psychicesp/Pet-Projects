        in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17+1d8

traits:
    Creature Sense: The ulitharid is aware of the presence of creatures within 2 miles
        of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance
        and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's intelligence score,
        but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank
        spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.
    Magic Resistance: The ulitharid has advantage on saving throws against spells
        and other magical effects.
    Psionic Hub: If an elder brain establishes a psychic link with the ulitharid,
        the elder brain can form a psychic link with any other creature the ulitharid
        can detect using its Creature Sense. Any such link ends if the creature falls
        outside the telepathy ranges of both the ulitharid and the elder brain. The
        ulitharid can maintain its psychic link with the elder brain regardless of
        the distance between them, so long as they are both on the same plane of existence.
        If the ulitharid is more than 5 miles away from the elder brain, it can end
        the psychic link at any time (no action required).
