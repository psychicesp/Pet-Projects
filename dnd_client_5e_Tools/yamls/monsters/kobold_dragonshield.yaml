traits:
    Dragon's Resistance: 'The kobold has resistance to a type of damage based on the
        color of dragon that invested it with power (choose or roll a d10): 1xe2x80x932,
        acid (black); 3xe2x80x934, cold (white); 5xe2x80x936, fire (red); 7xe2x80x938,
        lightning (blue); 9xe2x80x9310, poison (green).'
    Heart of the Dragon: If the kobold is frightened or paralyzed by an effect that
        allows a saving throw, it can repeat the save at the start of its turn to
        end the effect on itself and all kobolds within 30 feet of it. Any kobold
        that benefits from this trait (including the dragonshield) has advantage on
        its next attack roll.
    Pack Tactics: The kobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if
        at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the
        ally isn't incapacitated.
    Sunlight Sensitivity: While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack
        rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
