        damage if used with two hands.'

        one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'In humanoid form, the deep scion makes two melee attacks. In hybrid

        claws.'
    Psychic Screech (Hybrid Form Only; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The
        deep scion emits a terrible scream audible within 300 feet. Creatures within
        30 feet of the deep scion must succeed on a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Wisdom saving throw
        or be stunned until the end of the deep scion's next turn. In water, the psychic
        screech also telepathically transmits the deep scion's memories of the last
        24 hours to its master, regardless of distance, so long as it and its master
        are in the same body of water.
