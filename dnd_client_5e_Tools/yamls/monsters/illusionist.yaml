    Displacement (Recharges after the Illusionist Casts an Illusion Spell of 1st Level or Higher): As
        a bonus action, the illusionist projects an illusion that makes the illusionist
        appear to be standing in a place a few inches from its actual location, causing
        any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the illusionist.
        The effect ends if the illusionist takes damage, it is incapacitated, or its
        speed becomes 0.
