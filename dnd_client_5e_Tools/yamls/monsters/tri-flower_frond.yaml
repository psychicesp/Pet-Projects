HP: 11 (2d8 + 2)
actions:
    Multiattack: The tri-flower frond uses its orange blossom, then its yellow blossom,
        and then its red blossom.
    Orange Blossom: The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5
        feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Constitution saving
        throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the target is
        unconscious. At the end of each minute, the poisoned target can repeat the
        saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    Red Blossom: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +2+1d4 + 0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11+1d4
        + 9). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 5 (2d4) poison damage at the
        start of each of its turns. The red blossom can grapple only one target at
        a time. Another creature within reach of the tri-flower frond can use its
        action to end the grapple on the target.'
    Yellow Blossom: The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5
        feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Dexterity saving throw,
        or it is covered with corrosive sap and takes 5 acid damage at the start of
        each of its turns. Dousing the target with water reduces the acid damage by
        1 point per pint or flask of water used.
