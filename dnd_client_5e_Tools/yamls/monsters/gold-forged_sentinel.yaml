    Fire Breath (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The sentinel exhales fire in a 15-foot cone.
        Each creature in that area must make a DC 15+1d6 + 12 Dexterity saving throw,
        taking 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
        successful one.
    Multiattack: The sentinel makes two ram attacks.
    Ram: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
        (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.'

traits:
    Charge: If the sentinel moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then
        hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6)
        bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15+1d6
        + 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
    Spell Turning: The sentinel has advantage on saving throws against any spell that
        targets only the sentinel (not an area). If the sentinel's saving throw succeeds
        and the spell is of 4th level or lower, the spell has no effect on the sentinel
        and instead targets the caster.
