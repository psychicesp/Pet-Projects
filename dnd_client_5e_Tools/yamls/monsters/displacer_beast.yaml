traits:
    Avoidance: If the displacer beast is subjected to an effect that allows it to
        make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if
        it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
    Displacement: The displacer beast projects a magical illusion that makes it appear
        to be standing near its actual location, causing attack rolls against it to
        have disadvantage. If it is hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until
        the end of its next turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displacer
        beast is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.
