traits:
    Creature Sense: The neothelid is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile
        of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance
        and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's Intelligence score,
        but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank
        spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.
    Magic Resistance: The neothelid has advantage on saving throws against spells
        and other magical effects.
