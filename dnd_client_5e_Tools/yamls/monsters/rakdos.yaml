        Sadistic Revelry: ' Each creature within 60 feet of Rakdos that is his ally
            or is charmed by him must use its reaction to move up to half its speed
            toward the creature closest to it that it can see, provided it isn''t
            already within 5 feet of that creature. It then must make one melee attack
            against that creature if it is able to do so.'
        Scythe (Costs 2 Actions): ' Rakdos uses Curtain-Call Scythe.'
        Touch of Pain (Costs 3 Actions): ' Rakdos makes a claw attack against one
            creature within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 25+1d14
            + 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned
            in this way, the creature can''t maintain concentration on a spell or
            any other effect that requires concentration. The poisoned creature can
            repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
            on itself on a success.'
