    Multiattack: The magen makes two Shocking Touch attacks.
    Shocking Touch: 'Melee Spell Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target
        (the magen has advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor
        made of metal). Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) lightning damage.'
    Static Discharge (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The magen discharges a lightning bolt
        in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make
        a DC 14+1d4 + 12 Dexterity saving throw (with disadvantage if the creature
        is wearing armor made of metal), taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed
        save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
