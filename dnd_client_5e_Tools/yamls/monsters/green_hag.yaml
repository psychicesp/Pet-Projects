HP: 82 (11d8 + 33)
actions:
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d4 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Illusory Appearance: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
        with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general
        size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action
        to end it or if she dies.
    Invisible Passage: The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts
        a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
        While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can
        be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible
        with her.

    actions:
    - Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid
        walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.
    - The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each
        one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked
        (requiring a successful DC 20+1d4 + 18 Strength check to force open) until
        she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again
        to open them.
    - The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space.
        As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal
        to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action
        required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take
        actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up
        and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears
        if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses
        it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair
        action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any
        real objects in its possession.
