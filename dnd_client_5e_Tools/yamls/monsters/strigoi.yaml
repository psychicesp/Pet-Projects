actions:
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
        (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 6 (1d12) acid damage.'
    Multiattack: The strigoi makes one Claw attack and makes one Proboscis attack.
    Proboscis: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the strigoi
        regains hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt. A creature
        reduced to 0 hit points from this attack dies and leaves nothing behind except
        its skin and its equipment.'
    Ravenous Children (1/Day): The strigoi magically summons 1d4 + 2 stirges (see
        their entry in the Monster Manual) in unoccupied spaces it can see within
        30 feet of it. The stirges are under the strigoi's control and act immediately
        after the strigoi in the initiative order. The stirges disappear after 1 hour,
        when the strigoi dies, or when the strigoi dismisses them (no action required).
