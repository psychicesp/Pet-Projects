    Flitterstep (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The eidolon magically teleports to an unoccupied

traits:
    Blurred Form: Attack rolls against the eidolon are made with disadvantage unless
        the eidolon is incapacitated.
    Evasion: If the eidolon is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity
        saving throw to take only half damage, the eidolon instead takes no damage
        if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can't
        use this trait if it's incapacitated.
    Incorporeal Movement: The eidolon can move through other creatures and objects
        as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends
        its turn inside an object.

        that turns undead.
