traits:
    Aggressive: As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile
        creature that it can see.
    Corrupted Carrier: When the orc is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes, and any
        creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Constitution saving
        throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and becomes
        poisoned. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.
        A creature poisoned by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each
        of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. While poisoned by this
        effect, a creature can't regain hit points.
    Nurtured One of Yurtrus: The orc has advantage on saving throws against poison
        and disease.
