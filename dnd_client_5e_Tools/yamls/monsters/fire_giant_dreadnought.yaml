actions:
    Fireshield: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +13+1d10 + 8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage plus 7 (2d6)
        piercing damage.'
    Multiattack: The giant makes two fireshield attacks.
    Rock: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +13+1d10 + 8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target.
        Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.'
    Shield Charge: The giant moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through
        the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first time it enters a creature's
        space during this move, it makes a fireshield attack against that creature.
        If the attack hits, the target must also succeed on a DC 21+1d10 + 16 Strength
        saving throw or be pushed ahead of the giant for the rest of this move. If
        a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone and takes
        18 (3d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage, or 29 (6d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage if it
        was already prone.
