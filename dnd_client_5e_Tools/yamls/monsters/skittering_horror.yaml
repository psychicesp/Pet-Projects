    Maddening Presence: The horror targets one creature it can see within 30 feet
        of it. If the target can see or hear the horror, the target must make a DC
        17+1d10 + 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target becomes
        paralyzed until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is
        successful, the creature is immune to the horror's Maddening Presence for
        the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The horror can use its Maddening Presence and make three attacks:
        one with its bite and two with its claws.'
