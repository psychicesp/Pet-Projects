actions:
    Maddening Feast: The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy within 5 feet of her
        that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag's choice that is
        within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15+1d6 + 12
        Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened
        in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say,
        can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement,
        which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
        of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
        throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
        hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.

        (2d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.'

    actions:
    - Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid
        walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.
    - The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each
        one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked
        (requiring a successful DC 20+1d6 + 17 Strength check to force open) until
        she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again
        to open them.
    - The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space.
        As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal
        to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action
        required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take
        actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up
        and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears
        if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses
        it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair
        action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any
        real objects in its possession.

traits:
    Graystaff Magic: The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray wood that is a
        focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff as if it were a broom of
        flying. While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate
        Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff
        is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a
        day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.
    Ice Walk: The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make
        an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow
        doesn't cost her extra moment.
