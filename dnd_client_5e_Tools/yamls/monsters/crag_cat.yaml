traits:
    Nondetection: The cat cannot be targeted or detected by any divination magic or
        perceived through magical scrying sensors.
    Pounce: If the cat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature then hits
        it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC13
        Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the cat
        can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
    Spell Turning: The cat has advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets
        only the cat (not an area). If the cat's saving throw succeeds and the spell
        is of 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on the cat and instead targets
        the caster.
