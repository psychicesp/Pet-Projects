traits:
    Aura of False Divinity: A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the
        radiant idol must make a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Wisdom saving throw, provided the
        radiant idol isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is charmed
        by the radiant idol. A creature charmed in this way can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        Once it succeeds on the saving throw, a creature is immune to this radiant
        idol's Aura of False Divinity for 24 hours.
    Magic Resistance: The radiant idol has advantage on saving throws against spells
        and other magical effects.
