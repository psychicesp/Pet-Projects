traits:
    Magic Resistance: The archon has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.
    Mount: If the archon isn't mounted, it can use a bonus action to magically teleport
        onto the creature serving as its mount, provided the archon and its mount
        are on the same plane of existence. When it teleports, the archon appears
        astride the mount, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying. While
        mounted and not incapacitated, the archon can't be surprised, and both it
        and its mount have advantage on Dexterity saving throws. If the archon is
        reduced to 0 hit points while riding its mount, the mount is reduced to 0
        hit points as well.
    Radiant Rebirth (Recharges after a Long Rest): If the archon is reduced to 0 hit
        points, it regains 30 hit points and springs back to its feet with a burst
        of radiance. Each creature of the archon's choice within 30 feet of it must
        succeed on a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Constitution saving throw, or the creature takes
        13 (3d8) radiant damage and is blinded until the start of the archon's turn.
