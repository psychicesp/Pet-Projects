        Hit: 23 (3d8 + 10) radiant damage, and Trostani can choose one magic item

        a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        Awaken Grove Guardians (Costs 3 Actions): ' Trostani animates one or two trees
            she can see within 120 feet of her, causing them to uproot themselves
            and become awakened trees (see the Monster Manual for their stat blocks)
            for 1 minute or until Trostani uses a bonus action to end the effect.
            These trees understand Druidic and obey Trostani''s spoken commands, but
            can''t speak. If she issues no commands to them, the trees do nothing
            but follow her and take the Dodge action.'

            counts as one of her daily uses of the spell.'
