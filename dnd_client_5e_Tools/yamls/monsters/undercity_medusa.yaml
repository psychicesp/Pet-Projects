AC: 16
CR: 6 (2,300 XP)
HP: 120 (16d8 + 48)
actions:
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
        (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: The medusa makes two claw attacks. It can also use Petrifying Gaze
        before or after making these attacks.
    Petrifying Gaze: The medusa fixes its gaze on one creature within 60 feet of it
        that it can see and that can see its eyes. The target must make a DC 14+1d6
        + 11 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the
        creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save
        begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat
        the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure
        or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature
        is freed by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.
