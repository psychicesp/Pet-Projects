traits:
    Aura of Annihilation: The bodak can activate or deactivate this feature as a bonus
        action. While active, the aura deals 5 necrotic damage to any creature that
        ends its turn within 30 feet of the bodak. Undead and fiends ignore this effect.
    Death Gaze: When a creature that can see the bodak's eyes starts its turn within
        30 feet of the bodak, the bodak can force it to make a DC 13+1d6 + 10 Constitution
        saving throw if the bodak isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If
        the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points,
        unless it is immune to the frightened condition. Otherwise, a creature takes
        16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save.
    Sunlight Hypersensitivity: The bodak takes 5 radiant damage when it starts its
        turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and
        ability checks.
