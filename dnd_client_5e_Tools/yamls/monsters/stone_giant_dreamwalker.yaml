AC: 18
CR: 10 (5,900 XP)
HP: 161 (14d12 + 70)
actions:
    Greatclub: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
        Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.'
    Multiattack: The giant makes two attacks with its greatclub.
    Petrifying Touch: The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet
        of it that is charmed by it. The target must make a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Constitution
        saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes petrified, and the giant
        can adhere the target to its stony body. Greater restoration spells and other
        magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a petrified creature on
        the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally,
        freeing the petrified creature as well as ending the petrified condition on
        it.
    Rock: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target.
        Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
        succeed on a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.'

    Dreamwalker's Charm: An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant
        must make a DC 13+1d8 + 9 Charisma saving throw, provided that the giant isn't
        incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the giant. A creature
        charmed in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
        turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the saving
        throw, the creature is immune to this giant's Dreamwalker's Charm for 24 hours.
