    Multiattack: 'The leviathan makes two attacks: one with its slam and one with
        its tail.'
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +16+1d12 + 10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        15 (1d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) acid damage.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +16+1d12 + 10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        16 (1d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 6 (1d12) acid damage.'
    Tidal Wave (Recharge 6): While submerged, the leviathan magically creates a wall
        of water centered on itself. The wall is up 250 feet long, up to 250 feet
        high, and up to 50 feet thick. When the wall appears, all other creatures
        within its area must each make a DC 24+1d12 + 18 Strength saving throw. A
        creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one.
