actions:
    Multiattack: The elemental makes two slam attacks.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8+1d6 + 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
        (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.'
    "Whirlwind (Recharge 4\u20136)": Each creature in the elemental's space must make
        a DC 13+1d6 + 10 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8
        + 2) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in
        a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object,
        such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every
        10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature
        must succeed on a DC 13+1d6 + 10 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage
        and be knocked prone.
