actions:
    Mind-Breaking Howl (Recharge 6): The howler emits a keening howl in a 60-foot
        cone. Each creature in that area that isn't deafened must succeed on a DC
        16+1d6 + 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the howler's
        next turn. While a creature is frightened in this way, its speed is halved,
        and it is incapacitated. A target that successfully saves is immune to the
        Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: The howler makes two bite attacks.
    Rending Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is frightened it takes an
        additional 22 (4d10) psychic damage. This attack ignores damage resistance.'
