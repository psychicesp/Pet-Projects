HP: 147 (14d12 + 56)
actions:
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +11+1d8 + 7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.'
    Malevolent Presence: Any creature with an Intelligence of 4 or more that is within
        30 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Wisdom saving throw
        or be charmed by it for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If
        a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature
        is immune to the dragon's Malevolent Presence for the next 24 hours. A creature
        charmed in this way fixates on another creature or object that the dragon
        mentally chooses and must, on each of its turns, move as close as it can to
        that target and use its action to make a melee attack against it. If the dragon
        doesn't choose a target, the charmed creature can act normally on its turn.
    Multiattack: 'The dragon uses its Malevolent Presence. It then makes three attacks:
        two with its claws and one with its tail. If the dragon isn''t flying, it
        can also make one attack with its wings.'
    Radiant Breath (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The dragon exhales a ray of radiant energy
        in a 120-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make
        a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) radiant damage on
        a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +11+1d8 + 7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.'
    Wings: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +11+1d8 + 7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        12 (2d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage.'
