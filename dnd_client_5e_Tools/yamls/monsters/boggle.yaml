traits:
    Boggle Oil: The boggle excretes nonflammable oil from its pores. The boggle chooses
        whether the oil is slippery or sticky and can change the oil on its skin from
        one consistency to another as a bonus action.
    Dimensional Rift: As a bonus action, the boggle can create an invisible and immobile
        rift within an opening or frame it can see within 5 feet of it, provided that
        the space is no bigger than 10 feet on any side. The dimensional rift bridges
        the distance between that space and any point within 30 feet of it that the
        boggle can see or specify by distance and direction (such as "30 feet straight
        up"). While next to the rift, the boggle can see through it and is considered
        to be next to the destination as well, and anything the boggle puts through
        the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only
        the boggle can use the rift, and it lasts until the end of the boggle's next
        turn.
    Uncanny Smell: The boggle has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely
        on smell.
