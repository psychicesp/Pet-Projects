actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.'
    Constrict: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or
        smaller creature. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6)
        slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16+1d8 + 12) if the behir
        isn''t already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until
        this grapple ends.'
    Lightning Breath (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The behir exhales a line of lightning
        that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make
        a DC 16+1d8 + 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage
        on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    Multiattack: 'The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.'
    Swallow: The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it
        is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple
        ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total
        cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21
        (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have
        only one creature swallowed at a time.
