    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9+1d10 + 4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage.'
    Grasping Spout: The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature
        it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17+1d10 + 12 Strength
        saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it's underwater. On a failed save,
        it takes 22 (4d8 + 4) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith.
        On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
    Multiattack: 'The wastrilith uses Grasping Spout and makes three attacks: one
        with its bite and two with its claws.'

traits:
    Amphibious: The wastrilith can breathe air and water.
    Corrupt Water: At the start of each of the wastrilith's turns, exposed water within
        30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area
        until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until
        it evaporates.
    Magic Resistance: The wastrilith has advantage on saving throws against spells
        and other magical effects.
    Undertow: As a bonus action when the wastrilith is underwater, it can cause all
        water within 60 feet of it to be difficult terrain for other creatures until
        the start of its next turn.
