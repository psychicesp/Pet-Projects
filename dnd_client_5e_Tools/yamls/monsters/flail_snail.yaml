actions:
    Flail Tentacle: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
        Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.'
    Multiattack: The flail snail makes as many flail tentacle attacks as it has flail
        tentacles, all against the same target.
    Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The snail's shell
        emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the snail's next turn. During
        this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light
        for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage
        on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light
        and able to see the snail when this power is activated must succeed on a DC
        15+1d4 + 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the light ends.
    Shell Defense: The flail snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +4 bonus to
        AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its
        turn.

traits:
    Antimagic Shell: 'The snail has advantage on saving throws against spells, and
        any creature making a spell attack against the snail has disadvantage on the
        attack roll. If the snail succeeds on its saving throw against a spell or
        a spell attack misses it, an additional effect might occur, as determined
        by rolling a d6:'
    Flail Tentacles: The flail snail has five flail tentacles. Whenever the snail
        takes 10 damage or more on a single turn, one of its tentacles dies. If even
        one tentacle remains, the snail regrows all dead ones within 1d4 days. If
        all its tentacles die, the snail retracts into its shell, gaining total cover,
        and it begins wailing, a sound that can be heard for 600 feet, stopping only
        when it dies 5d6 minutes later. Healing magic that restores limbs, such as
        the regenerate spell, can halt this dying process.
