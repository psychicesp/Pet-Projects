actions:
    Multiattack: The golem makes two slam attacks.
    Slam: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +10+1d8 + 6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        24 (4d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.'
    Slow (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The golem targets one or more creatures it can see
        within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17+1d8 + 13 Wisdom saving
        throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions,
        its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In
        addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn,
        not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
