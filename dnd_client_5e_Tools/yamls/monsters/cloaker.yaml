CR: 8 (3,900 XP)
HP: 78 (12d10 + 12)
actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit:
        10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker
        attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker
        attaches to the target''s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe
        while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack
        only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker
        can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including
        the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC
        16+1d6 + 13 Strength check.'
    Moan: Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that
        isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13+1d6 + 10 Wisdom saving throw or
        become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's
        saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for
        the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its
        tail.'
    Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The cloaker magically creates
        three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates
        move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible
        to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area
        of bright light, the duplicates disappear.
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit:
        7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.'
