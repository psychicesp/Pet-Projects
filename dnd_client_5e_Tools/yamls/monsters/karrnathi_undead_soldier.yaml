    Pack Tactics: The soldier has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if
        at least one of the soldier's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and
        the ally isn't incapacitated.
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces the soldier to 0 hit points, it must make
        a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the
        damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the soldier drops
        to 1 hit point instead.
