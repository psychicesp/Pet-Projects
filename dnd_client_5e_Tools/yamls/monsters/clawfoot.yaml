    Pack Tactics: The clawfoot has advantage on an attack roll against a creature
        if at least one of the clawfoot's allies is within 5 feet of the creature
        and the ally isn't incapacitated.
    Pounce: If the clawfoot moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and
        then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed
        on a DC 11+1d4 + 9 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target
        is prone, the clawfoot can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
