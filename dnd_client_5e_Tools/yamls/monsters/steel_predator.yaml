    Stunning Roar (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The steel predator emits a roar in a 60-foot
        cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19+1d10 + 14 Constitution
        saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10) thunder damage,
        drops everything it's holding, and is stunned for 1 minute. On a successful
        save, a creature takes half as much damage. The stunned creature can repeat
        the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
        on a success.
