AC: 16
CR: 7 (2,900 XP)
HP: 68 (8d8 + 32)
actions:
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        13 (4d4 + 3) slashing damage.'
    Multiattack: 'The quori makes three attacks: one pincer attack, one attack with
        its claws, and one stinger attack.'
    Pincer: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14+1d6
        + 11) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The quori has two pincers, each
        of which can grapple one target.'
    Possession (Recharge 6): One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of
        it must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Charisma saving throw or be possessed
        by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and
        loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive
        the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell,
        or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
        and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed
        target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class
        features, or proficiencies.
    Stinger: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +6+1d6 + 3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.
        Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the target
        must succeed on a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the
        quori for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
        of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.'
