traits:
    Bottom Treader: The drowned assassin cannot swim, and it sinks to the bottom of
        any body of water. It takes no penalties to its movement or attacks underwater.
        It is immune to the effects of being underwater at a depth greater than 100
        feet.
    Bound Together: The drowned assassin shares its mind with every other drowned
        one within 1 mile of it, and can communicate its thoughts and observations
        to them instantaneously and without limitation.
    Undead Fortitude: If damage reduces the drowned assassin to 0 hit points, it must
        make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless
        the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the drowned assassin
        drops to 1 hit point instead.
