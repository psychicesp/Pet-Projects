traits:
    Fey Step (Recharge 4xe2x80x936): As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up
        to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
    Magic Resistance: The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and
        other magical effects.
    Sorrowful Presence: Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet
        of the eladrin must make a DC 13+1d8 + 9 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
        save, the creature is charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the
        creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. The charmed
        creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
        the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful
        or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Sorrowful
        Presence for the next 24 hours.
