    Warp Shadow: The peryton chooses up to three creatures within 60 feet of it that
        it can see. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14+1d8 + 10 Wisdom saving throw
        or become cursed. While cursed, whenever the creature makes an attack roll,
        an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract that number
        from the roll. A cursed creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of
        each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature
        that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this peryton's Warp Shadow
        for 24 hours.
