    Illusory Appearance: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
        with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general
        size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action
        to end it or if she dies.
    Invisible Passage: The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts
        a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
        While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can
        be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible
        with her.
