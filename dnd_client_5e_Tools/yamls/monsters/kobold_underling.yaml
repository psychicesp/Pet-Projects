traits:
    Messy End: The kobold explodes 3 rounds after it dies, or immediately if it was
        killed by a critical hit. The explosion destroys the kobold's body, leaving
        its equipment behind. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding kobold
        must make a DC 10+1d4 + 8 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) bludgeoning
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    Pack Tactics: The kobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if
        at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the
        ally isn't incapacitated.
    Sunlight Sensitivity: While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack
        rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
