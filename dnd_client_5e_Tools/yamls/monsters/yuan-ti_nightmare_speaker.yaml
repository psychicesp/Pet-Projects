AC: 14
CR: 4 (1,100 XP)
HP: 71 (13d8 + 13)
actions:
    Constrict: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
        Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC
        14+1d4 + 12) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends,
        the target is restrained, and the yuan-ti can''t constrict another target.'
    Invoke Nightmare (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The yuan-ti taps into
        the nightmares of a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates an
        illusory, immobile manifestation of the creature's deepest fears, visible
        only to that creature. The target must make a DC 13+1d4 + 11 Intelligence
        saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage
        and is frightened of the manifestation, believing it to be real. The yuan-ti
        must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if concentrating on a spell),
        which lasts for up to 1 minute and can't be harmed. The target can repeat
        the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the illusion on a
        success, or taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failure.
    Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only): The yuan-ti makes one constrict attack and one
        scimitar attack.
    Scimitar (Yuan-ti Form Only): 'Melee Weapon Attack: +5+1d4 + 3 to hit, reach 5
        ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.'
