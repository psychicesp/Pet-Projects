    Breath of Hopelessness (Recharge 5xe2x80x936): The eater of hope exhales a miasma
        of Underworld winds in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make
        a DC 14+1d6 + 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
        26 (4d12) necrotic damage and is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this
        way, the target takes an extra 6 (1d12) necrotic damage whenever the eater
        of hope hits it with an attack. On a successful save, the target takes half
        as much damage and isn't cursed.
    Claws: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +7+1d6 + 4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
        8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.'

traits:
    Insatiable Greed: The eater of hope can sense the presence of gold within 1,000
        feet of itself. It can determine which location has the greatest amount of
        gold and can sense the direction to that site. If the gold is being moved,
        it knows the direction of the movement. It can't locate gold if any thickness
        of clay or lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between it and the
        gold.
    Magic Resistance: The eater of hope has advantage on saving throws against spells
        and other magical effects.
