actions:
    Bite: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
        19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.'
    "Breath Weapons (Recharge 5\u20136)": The dragon uses one of the following breath
        weapons.
    Change Shape: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has
        a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It
        reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
        is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).
    Claw: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
        15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.'
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet
        of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19+1d14 + 12 Wisdom saving
        throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
        throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
        creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
    Multiattack: 'The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks:
        one with its bite and two with its claws.'
    Tail: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +15+1d14 + 8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
        17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.'

    actions:
    - The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of
        it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that
        point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts
        until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
    - The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within
        120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature
        on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15+1d14
        + 8 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature
        can take an action to attempt a DC 15+1d14 + 8 Strength check, freeing itself
        or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on
        a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative
        count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free
        increases to 20.

            saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
            The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.'
