description: Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory
    creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius
    sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving
    throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion
    calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an
    implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must
    succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful
    save, the spell ends for that creature.
