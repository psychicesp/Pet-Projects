description: For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed
    at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you. When the spell ends,
    the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile
    toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might
    seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature
    of your interaction with it.
