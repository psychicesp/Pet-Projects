description: Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright
    light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end
    the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. The flames provide you with
    a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance
    to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage. In
    addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack,
    the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield,
    or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.
