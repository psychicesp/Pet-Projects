description: A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll
    6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures
    in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their
    current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).
    Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature
    affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each
    creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the
    next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than
    the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
