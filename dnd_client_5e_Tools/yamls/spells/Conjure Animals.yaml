    what appears:One beast of challenge rating 2 or lowerTwo beasts of challenge rating
    1 or lowerFour beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lowerEight beasts of challenge
    rating 1/4 or lowerEach beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it
    drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly
    to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group,
    which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them
    (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend
    themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the
    creatures' statistics.
