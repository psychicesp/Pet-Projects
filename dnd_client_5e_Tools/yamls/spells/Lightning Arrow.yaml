description: The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration,
    the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms
    into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes 4d8
    lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's
    normal damage. Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target
    must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes 2d8 lightning
    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The piece
    of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.
duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
higher_levels: ' When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher,
    the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level
    above 3rd.'
