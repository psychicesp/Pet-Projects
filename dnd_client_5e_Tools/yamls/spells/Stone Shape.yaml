description: You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone
    no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your
    purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or
    coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than
    5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door
    shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical
    detail isn't possible.
