description: You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within
    range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw,
    taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
    one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your
    next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to
    it. Statistics for the zombie are in the Monster Manual. If you target an undead
    with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The
    target gains half the total as temporary hit points.
