description: You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends,
    any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell
    must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose
    a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded
    creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball. If the warded
    creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage
    to another creature, this spell ends.
