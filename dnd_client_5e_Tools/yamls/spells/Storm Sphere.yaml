description: A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered
    on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.
    Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed
    on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space
    is difficult terrain. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each
    of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere
    toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell
    attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere.
    On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage. Creatures within 30 feet of the
    sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.
duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
