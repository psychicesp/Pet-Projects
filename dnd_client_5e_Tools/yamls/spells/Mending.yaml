description: This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such
    as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin.
    As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend
    it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a
    magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.
