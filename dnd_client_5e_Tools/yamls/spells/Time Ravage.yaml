description: You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical
    form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution
    saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
    on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where
    it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target
    has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking
    speed is halved. Only the wish spell or the greater restoration cast with a 9th-level
    spell slot can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.
