description: You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius
    sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends,
    a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts
    its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
    can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature
    succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell
    and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with
    a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within
    the boundaries of the truth.
