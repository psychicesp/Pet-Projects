description: You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within
    range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill
    of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain
    hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the
    target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls
    against you until the end of your next turn. This spell's damage increases by
    1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
