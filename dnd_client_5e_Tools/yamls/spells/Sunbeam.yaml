description: A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide,
    60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw.
    On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your
    next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded
    by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw. You can
    create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.
    For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright
    light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light
    is sunlight.
