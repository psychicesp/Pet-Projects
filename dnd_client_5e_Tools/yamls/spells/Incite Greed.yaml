description: When you cast this spell, you present the gem used as the material component
    and choose any number of creatures within range that can see you. Each target
    must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the spell ends,
    or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. While charmed in this
    way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement to approach you in a safe
    manner. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of you, it cannot move, but
    simply stares greedily at the gem you present. At the end of each of its turns,
    an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect
    ends for that target.
