description: Flames race across your body, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius
    and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the spell's duration. The flames don't
    harm you. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:You are immune
    to fire damage and have resistance to cold damage. Any creature that moves within
    5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire
    damage. You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet
    wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must
    make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 fire damage on a failed save,
    or half as much damage on a successful one.
