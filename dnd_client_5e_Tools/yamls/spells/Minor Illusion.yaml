description: You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for
    the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this
    spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.
    It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums,
    or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration,
    or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. If you
    create an image of an objectxe2x80x94such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small
    chestxe2x80x94it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create
    sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the
    image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. If a creature
    uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that
    it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
    your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion
    becomes faint to the creature.
