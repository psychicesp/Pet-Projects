description: You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement
    is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither
    reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.
    The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical
    restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being
    underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.
