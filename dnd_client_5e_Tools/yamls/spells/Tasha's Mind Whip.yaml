description: You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The
    target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
    3d6 psychic damage, and it can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn.
    Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action,
    or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target
    takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.
duration: 1 round
