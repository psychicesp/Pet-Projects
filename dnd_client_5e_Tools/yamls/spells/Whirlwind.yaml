description: A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within
    range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that
    point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up
    to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium
    or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried
    by anyone. A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn
    that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including
    when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on
    a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large
    or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw
    or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts
    its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside
    it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind
    and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.
    A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check
    against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained
    by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 xc3x97 10 feet away from it in a random direction.
