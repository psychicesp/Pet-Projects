description: Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall
    cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The
    area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The ground
    in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature
    enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
    it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. If a
    creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is concentrating on a spell,
    the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell
    save DC or lose concentration.
