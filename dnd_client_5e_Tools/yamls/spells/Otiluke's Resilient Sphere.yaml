description: A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size
    or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
    On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. Nothingxe2x80x94not
    physical objects, energy, or other spell effectsxe2x80x94can pass through the
    barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere
    is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks
    or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage
    anything outside it. The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain
    the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push
    against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's
    speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures. A disintegrate
    spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.
