description: You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with
    which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes
    you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately.
    The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand
    the meaning of your message. You can send the message across any distance and
    even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than
    you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.
