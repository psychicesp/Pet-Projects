description: You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination
    spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature
    or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another creature. When you cast
    the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the
    duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for
    30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it
    is dispelled. False Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and
    magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make
    a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change
    the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of
    magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the
    false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item. Mask. You change the
    way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types,
    such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose
    a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it
    were a creature of that type or of that alignment. False Aura. You change the
    way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that
    detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical
    object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears
    to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect

    the item. Mask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects
