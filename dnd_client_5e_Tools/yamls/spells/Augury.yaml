description: By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate
    cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly
    entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take
    within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:Weal,
    for good resultsWoe, for bad resultsWeal and woe, for both good and bad resultsNothing,
    for results that aren't especially good or badThe spell doesn't take into account
    any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting
    of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell
    two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative
    25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.
    The DM makes this roll in secret.
