description: Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants.
    You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur
    within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase,
    a cryptic rhyme, or an omen. The spell doesn't take into account any possible
    circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional
    spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times
    before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance
    for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this
    roll in secret.
