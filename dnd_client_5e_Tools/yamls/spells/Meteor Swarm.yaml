description: Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you
    can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each
    point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around
    corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more
    than one fiery burst is affected only once. The spell damages objects in the area
    and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
