description: You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make
    a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are
    fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell
    ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature
    regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows
    it was charmed by you.
