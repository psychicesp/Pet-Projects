description: You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years
    and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and
    willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points. This spell
    closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses
    affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs
    and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.
    The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which
    case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied
    space you choose within 10 feet of you.
