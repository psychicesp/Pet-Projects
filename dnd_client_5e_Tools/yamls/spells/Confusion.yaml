description: This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and
    provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered
    on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when
    you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target can't take reactions
    and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior
    for that turn. Confusion Behaviourd10Behavior1The creature uses all its movement
    to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign
    a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. 2-6The
    creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. 7-8The creature uses its action
    to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach.
    If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
    9-10The creature can act and move normally. At the end of each of its turns, an
    affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends
    for that target.
