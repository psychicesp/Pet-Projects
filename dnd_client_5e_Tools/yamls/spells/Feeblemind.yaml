description: You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting
    to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage
    and must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence
    and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items,
    understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can,
    however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them. At the end
    of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell.
    If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends. The spell can also be ended
    by greater restoration, heal, or wish.
