description: You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The
    target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always
    know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you
    are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target
    can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, it gains no benefit from
    that condition against you.
duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
higher_levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher,
    the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
