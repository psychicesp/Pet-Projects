description: You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered
    on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily
    obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration. Each creature that is
    completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution
    saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action
    that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune
    to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. A moderate wind (at least
    10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least
    20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.
