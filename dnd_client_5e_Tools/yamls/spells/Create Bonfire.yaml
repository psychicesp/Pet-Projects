description: You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the
    spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's
    space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
    1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into
    the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The bonfire
    ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried. The spell's
    damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and
    17th level (4d8).
