description: 'You call forth a fey spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that
    you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Fey Spirit stat block.
    When you cast the spell, choose a mood: Fuming, Mirthful, or Tricksy. The creature
    resembles a fey creature of your choice marked by the chosen mood, which determines
    one of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to
    0 hit points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your companions.
    In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
    after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you
    don''t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.'
