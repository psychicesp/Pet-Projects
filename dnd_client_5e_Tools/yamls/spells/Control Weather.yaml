description: You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.
    You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't have
    a clear path to the sky ends the spell early. When you cast the spell, you change
    the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate
    and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4
    xc3x97 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you
    can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns
    to normal. When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on
    the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the
    wind, you can change its direction. PrecipitationStageCondition1Clear2Light clouds3Overcast
