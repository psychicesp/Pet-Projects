description: A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves
    with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead
    and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration. The barrier prevents an affected
    creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells
    or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier. If you move
    so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell
    ends.
