description: Do you need to squeeze a few more gold pieces out of a merchant as you
    try to sell that weird octopus statue you liberated from the chaos temple? Do
    you need to downplay the worth of some magical assets when the tax collector stops
    by? Distort value has you covered. You cast this spell on an object no more than
    1 foot on a side, doubling the object's perceived value by adding illusory flourishes
    or polish to it, or reducing its perceived value by half with the help of illusory
    scratches, dents, and other unsightly features. Anyone examining the object can
    ascertain its true value with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
    against your spell save DC.
duration: 8 hours
higher_levels: ' When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher,
    the maximum size of the object increases by 1 foot for each slot level above 1st.'
