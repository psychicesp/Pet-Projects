description: Until the spell ends, bits of rock spread across your body, and you gain
    the following benefits:You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
    damage from nonmagical attacks. You can use your action to create a small earthquake
    on the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground
    must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. You can move across
    difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement. You
    can move through solid earth or stone as if it was air and without destabilizing
    it, but you can't end your movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the
    nearest unoccupied space, this spell ends, and you are stunned until the end of
    your next turn.
