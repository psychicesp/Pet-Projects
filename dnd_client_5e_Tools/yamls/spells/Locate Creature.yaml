description: Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction
    to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you.
    If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement. The spell can
    locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific
    kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature
    up closexe2x80x94within 30 feetxe2x80x94at least once. If the creature you described
    or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph
    spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature. This spell can't locate a creature
    if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the
    creature.
