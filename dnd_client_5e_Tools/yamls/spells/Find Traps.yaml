description: You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of
    sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict
    a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically
    intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected
    by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would
    not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
    This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location
    of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap
    you sense.
