description: You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature
    with which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of
    existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same
    plane. Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words,
    images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link,
    and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The spell
    enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand the
    meaning of your words and take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to
    it.
