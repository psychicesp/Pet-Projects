description: You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical
    energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make
    a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed
    wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides
    three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.
    When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts
    its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
    the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes
    half as much damage.
