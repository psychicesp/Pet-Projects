description: Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the spell ends, causing you
    to become heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10 feet
    of you into darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim light. Until the
    spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition, whenever a creature
    within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the shadows lash out at that creature,
    dealing it 2d8 necrotic damage.
