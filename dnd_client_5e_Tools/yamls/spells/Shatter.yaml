description: A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of
    your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on
    that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder
    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature
    made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on
    this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes
    the damage if it's in the spell's area.
