description: The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists
    and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the
    duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing
    damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged
    to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is
    cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize
    the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
