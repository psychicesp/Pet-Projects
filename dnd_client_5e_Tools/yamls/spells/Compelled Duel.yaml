description: You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can
    see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
    is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage
    on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving
    throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away
    from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the
    target's movement for that turn. The spell ends if you attack any other creature,
    if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if
    a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it,
    or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
