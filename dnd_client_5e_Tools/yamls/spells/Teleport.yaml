description: This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures
    of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can
    see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must
    be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried
    by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and
    it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination
    determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults
    the table. TeleportationFamiliarityMishapSimilar AreaOff TargetOn TargetPermanent

    circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
    "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination
    within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen
    from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb. "Very familiar"
    is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a
    place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have
    seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is
    a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose
    location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from
    a map. "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to
    scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting
    to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your
    group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your
    group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination
    in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 xc3x97 1d10 percent of the
    distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles,
    landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off
    target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target
    randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east,
    and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal
    city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area.
    You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually
    or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory,
    for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical
    supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.
    Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no
    range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap. The
    spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature
    (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table
    to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
