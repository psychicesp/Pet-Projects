description: You establish a telepathic link with one beast you touch that is friendly
    to you or charmed by you. The spell fails if the beast's Intelligence score is
    4 or higher. Until the spell ends, the link is active while you and the beast
    are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand
    your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions
    and concepts back to you. While the link is active, the beast gains advantage
    on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.
