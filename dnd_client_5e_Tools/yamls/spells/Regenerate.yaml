description: You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target
    regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains
    1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute). The
    target's severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored
    after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell
    instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
