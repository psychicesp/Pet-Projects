description: A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you
    can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of
    magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force. A creature targeted
    by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target
    takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves
    it with 0 hit points. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and
    carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature
    can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
    This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or
    a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation
    of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item
    is unaffected by this spell.
