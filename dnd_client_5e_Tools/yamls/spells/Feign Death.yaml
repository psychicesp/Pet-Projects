description: You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that
    is indistinguishable from death. For the spell's duration, or until you use an
    action to touch the target and dismiss the spell, the target appears dead to all
    outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target
    is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance
    to all damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when
    you cast the spell, or becomes diseased or poisoned while under the spell's effect,
    the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.
