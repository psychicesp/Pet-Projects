description: You call forth a celestial spirit. It manifests in an angelic form in
    an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the
    Celestial Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Avenger or Defender.
    Your choice determines the creature's attack in its stat block. The creature disappears
    when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally
    to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count,
    but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no
    action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and
    uses its move to avoid danger.
