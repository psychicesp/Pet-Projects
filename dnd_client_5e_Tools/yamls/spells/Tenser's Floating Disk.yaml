description: This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter
    and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of
    your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration,
    and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends,
    and everything on the disk falls to the ground. The disk is immobile while you
    are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk
    follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven
    terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation
    change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep
    pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom. If you move
    more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle
    to follow you), the spell ends.
