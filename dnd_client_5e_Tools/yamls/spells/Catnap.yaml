description: You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your
    choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell's duration.
    The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action
    to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration,
    that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this
    spell again until it finishes a long rest.
duration: 10 minutes
extras: a pinch of sand
higher_levels: ' When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher,
    you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.'
