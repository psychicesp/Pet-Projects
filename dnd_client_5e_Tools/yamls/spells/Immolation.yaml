description: Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must
    make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half
    as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for
    the spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius
    and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the
    target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and
    the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished
    by nonmagical means. If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is turned
    to ash.
