description: An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot
    radius around you and remains for the duration. Any spell of 5th level or lower
    cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even
    if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target
    creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them.
    Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by
    such spells.
duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
extras: a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends
higher_levels: ' When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher,
    the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.'
