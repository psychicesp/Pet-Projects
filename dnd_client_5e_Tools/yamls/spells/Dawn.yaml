description: The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range.
    Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light
    glimmers there. This light is sunlight. When the cylinder appears, each creature
    in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this
    saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder. If you're within 60 feet
    of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.
