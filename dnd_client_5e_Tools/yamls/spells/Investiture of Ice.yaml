description: Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following
    benefits:You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage. You
    can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra
    movement. The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain
    for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you. You can use your action
    to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand
    in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution
    saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much
    damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect
    has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.
