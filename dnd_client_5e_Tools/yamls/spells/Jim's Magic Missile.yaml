description: xe2x80x9cJim's magic missile is an ancient and powerful spell, as well
    as being the name of my band in Wizard Academy. xe2x80x9dxe2x80x94 Jim DarkmagicAny
    apprentice wizard can cast a boring old magic missile. Sure, it always strikes
    its target. Yawn. Do away with the drudgery of your grandfather's magic with this
    improved version of the spell, as used by Jim Darkmagic!You create three twisting,
    whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force. Each dart targets
    a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack
    for each missile. On a hit, a missile deals 2d4 force damage to its target. If
    the attack roll scores a critical hit, the target of that missile takes 5d4 force
    damage instead of you rolling damage twice for a critical hit. If the attack roll
    for any missile is a 1, all missiles miss their targets and blow up in your face,
    dealing 1 force damage per missile to you.
