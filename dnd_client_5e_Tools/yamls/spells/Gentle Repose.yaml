description: You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is
    protected from decay and can't become undead. The spell also effectively extends
    the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the
    influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as raise
    dead.
duration: 10 days
extras: a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse's eyes,
    which must remain there for the duration
