description: Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting
    from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the
    area into difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must
    succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until
    the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make
    a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. When
    the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
