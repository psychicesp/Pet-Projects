description: You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered
    on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for
    the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area
    is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time
    on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving
    throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
    damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath
    or don't need to breathe. The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of
    each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being
    heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.
duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
higher_levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher,
    the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
