description: You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature
    in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target
    takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines
    the attack's damage type, as shown below. Chaos Boltd8Damage Type1Acid2Cold3Fire4Force5Lightning6Poison7Psychic8ThunderIf
    you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target
    to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack
    roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the
    chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each casting
    of this spell.
duration: Instantaneous
