    at a point you can see within range:One Medium or smaller creature that you choose

    You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held
    nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to
    10 feet away from you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage. You
