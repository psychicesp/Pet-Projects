description: You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature
    in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is
    holding and become frightened for the duration. While frightened by this spell,
    a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available
    route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends
    its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature
    can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that
    creature.
