description: You create intense pressure, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide
    whether the pressure pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each creature in that
    cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage
    on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. And every creature
    that fails the save is either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away
    from you, depending on the choice you made for the spell. In addition, unsecured
    objects that are completely within the cone are likewise pulled or pushed 15 feet.
duration: Instantaneous
higher_levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher,
    the damage increases by 1d6 and the distance pulled or pushed increases by 5 feet
    for each slot level above 3rd.
