    Walnut DankgrassYou address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and
    inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or
    not. Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration,
    each affected creature gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom
    saving throws. If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on
    the next attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit
    points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.
duration: 1 hour
