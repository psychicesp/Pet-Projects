description: You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your
    choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the
    duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this
    spell. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through
