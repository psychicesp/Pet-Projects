description: When you need to make sure something gets done, you can't rely on vague
    promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts of employment. When you cast this
    spell, choose one humanoid within range that can see and hear you, and that can
    understand you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed
    by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed in this way, it undertakes
    to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the
    best of its ability. You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is
    completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity
    might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature's normal
    activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try
    to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions
    are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the
    creature, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed
    by you.
duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
higher_levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher,
