description: You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message.
    The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper
    that only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are
    familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1
    foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
    blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel
    freely around corners or through openings.
