description: You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around you for the spell's
    duration. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable. Until the spell ends, any
    attack you make deals 1d8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet
    of you. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold (your choice when you cast the
    spell). Any creature that takes this damage can't regain hit points until the
    start of your next turn. In addition, any creature of your choice that you can
    see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet
    until the start of your next turn.
duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
