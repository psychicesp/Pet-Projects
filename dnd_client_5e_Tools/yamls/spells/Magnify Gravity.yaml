description: The gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see
    within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when
    you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
    creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its
    next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers
    no reduction to its speed. Until the start of your next turn, any object that
    isn't being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check
    against your spell save DC to pick up or move.
duration: 1 round
higher_levels: ' When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher,
    the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.'
