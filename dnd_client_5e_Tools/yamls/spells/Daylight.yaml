description: A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose
    within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional
    60 feet. If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn't being
    worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely
    covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm,
    blocks the light. If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness
    created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness
    is dispelled.
