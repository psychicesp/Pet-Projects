description: A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius
    and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell's
    duration. The wind has the following effects:It deafens you and other creatures
    in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized
    or smaller. It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong
    wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The attack rolls
    of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the
    wind.
