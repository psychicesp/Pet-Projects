description: 'You call forth the spirit of a construct. It manifests in an unoccupied
    space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Construct Spirit
    stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a material: Clay, Metal, or Stone.
    The creature resembles a golem or a modron (your choice) made of the chosen material,
    which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when
    it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you
    and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but
    it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action
    required by you). If you don''t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses
    its move to avoid danger.'
