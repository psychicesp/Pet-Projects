description: Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving
    throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other. Either creature
    can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds, the spell has no effect.
    If both saves fail, the creatures are magically linked for the duration, regardless
    of the distance between them. When damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage
    is dealt to the other one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same
    number of hit points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered
    creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends
    on one creature, it ends on both.
