description: 'You call forth a shadowy spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
    that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Shadow Spirit stat
    block. When you cast the spell, choose an emotion: Fury, Despair, or Fear. The
    creature resembles a misshapen biped marked by the chosen emotion, which determines
    certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit
    points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your companions.
    In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
    after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you
    don''t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.'

    use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.
