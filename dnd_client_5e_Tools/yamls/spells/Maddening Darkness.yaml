description: Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill
    a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners.
    A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light,
    as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the
    area. Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever
    a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw,
    taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
    one.
