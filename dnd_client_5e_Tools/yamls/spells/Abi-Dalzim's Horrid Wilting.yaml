description: You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered
    on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution
    saving throw. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals
    make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage
    on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical plants
    in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
